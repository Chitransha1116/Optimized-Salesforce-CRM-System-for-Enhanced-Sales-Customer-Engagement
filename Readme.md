#Project Documentation ##Skill Development & Employment Portal for Rural Youth on Salesforce

#Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis ##Project Title: ##Skill Development & Employment Portal for Rural Youth on Salesforce

Industry: Education & Employment (Social Impact)

Project Type: B2C & B2B Salesforce CRM Implementation

Target Users: ‚Ä¢ Rural Youth (job seekers & students) ‚Ä¢ Training Institutes / NGOs ‚Ä¢ Employers (Companies, SMEs) ‚Ä¢ Government Agencies

1.Problem Statement Rural youth often lack access to skill development opportunities and structured pathways to employment. Traditional methods (offline job fairs, manual tracking) are slow, fragmented, and ineffective in connecting skilled youth with potential employers.

The company/NGO wants to implement a Salesforce CRM system that:

‚Ä¢ Automates candidate registration and skill tracking ‚Ä¢ Enables employers to post jobs and shortlist candidates ‚Ä¢ Provides real-time dashboards for NGOs/Government monitoring ‚Ä¢ Sends alerts (SMS/Email) for interviews, jobs, and training updates

Proposed Solution: A "Skill Development & Employment Portal for Rural Youth" built on Salesforce CRM that:

‚Ä¢ Connects rural youth with training programs and job opportunities.

‚Ä¢ Provides real-time tracking of skill progress, certifications, and placements. ‚Ä¢ Bridges the gap between training institutes, NGOs, industries, and job seekers. ‚Ä¢ Uses Salesforce automation, analytics, and AI features to optimize the process.

Requirement Gathering ‚Ä¢ Identify pain points of rural youth (lack of exposure, mentorship, placement channels). ‚Ä¢ Identify needs of industries (skilled candidates, verified certifications, easy onboarding). ‚Ä¢ Identify NGO/training providers' needs (student progress monitoring, fund reporting). ‚Ä¢ Requirements from government bodies (impact reports, placement data).

Stakeholder Analysis Primary Stakeholders: Rural Youth (job seekers), Employers (industries, companies). Secondary Stakeholders: NGOs, Training Institutes, Skill Development Agencies. Tertiary Stakeholders: Government agencies, Placement officers, Salesforce admins. Stakeholders =>

o Rural Youth ‚Üí Candidates o Employers ‚Üí Job Providers o Training Institutes / NGOs ‚Üí Trainers & Program Managers o Government Agencies ‚Üí Regulators/Funders o System Admins & Developers ‚Üí Technical Setup

Business Process Mapping Current Scenario (Without Salesforce): ‚Ä¢ Manual registration through physical forms. ‚Ä¢ Limited or no digital skill progress tracking. ‚Ä¢ Difficult placement coordination. Proposed Future (With Salesforce): ‚Ä¢ Online registration of candidates through Salesforce Community portals. ‚Ä¢ Automated matching of skills with employer requirements. ‚Ä¢ Real-time dashboards for tracking training completion and job placements. ‚Ä¢ Automated email/SMS notifications for interviews, job fairs, and results.

Industry-specific Use Case Analysis ÔÉò Lead Management ‚Äì Capture candidate details from portal/social media ÔÉò Skill Tracking ‚Äì Manage training courses and certifications ÔÉò Employer Job Posting ‚Äì Employers post job requirements ÔÉò Interview Scheduling ‚Äì Schedule & notify candidates ÔÉò Placement Tracking ‚Äì Update deal status once candidate is hired ÔÉò Reporting ‚Äì Dashboards for job placements, skill program success

AppExchange Exploration Potential Salesforce AppExchange solutions to leverage: ÔÇß Learning Management Apps (LMS) ‚Üí To deliver training modules. ÔÇß Job Board / Recruitment Apps ‚Üí For candidate-employer matching. ÔÇß Survey Apps ‚Üí To collect feedback from candidates and employers. ÔÇß Analytics & Dashboards Apps ‚Üí For visualizing employment outcomes.

‚úÖ Phase 1 Deliverable By the end of Phase 1, we have: ÔÅ∂ A clear problem definition. ÔÅ∂ Identified stakeholders and their needs. ÔÅ∂ Business process mapping (current vs future). ÔÅ∂ Industry-specific use cases. ÔÅ∂ Possible AppExchange solutions to explore. ÔÅ∂ This lays the foundation for moving to Phase 2: Solution Architecture & Salesforce Org Setup.

‚úÖ Phase 2 Deliverable:

By the end of Phase 2, we have: ÔÅ∂ Configured company setup, users, profiles, roles, and OWDs. ÔÅ∂ Enabled Experience Cloud portals for candidates and employers.

Phase 3: Data Modeling & Relationships

Introduction o In this phase, we focus on designing the data model of the Salesforce application to represent real-world business processes. A well-structured data model ensures scalability, consistency, and efficient reporting. o This phase involves working with Standard Objects, Custom Objects, Fields, Record Types, Page Layouts, Compact Layouts, Schema Builder, Relationships, Junction Objects, and External Objects.
Standard & Custom Objects
Standard Objects ‚Ä¢ Predefined by Salesforce. ‚Ä¢ Examples relevant to my project:

o Account ‚Üí Represents customers or organizations.

o Contact ‚Üí Represents individuals related to accounts.

o Opportunity ‚Üí Tracks sales deals.

o Case ‚Üí Manages customer issues.

Custom Objects ‚Ä¢ Created by me to model my project-specific data (e.g., Job, Skill, Training, Student) to meet project-specific requirements. ‚Ä¢ Examples for my project (Job-Skill system): o Skill__c ‚Üí Stores different skills (e.g., Communication, Coding, Translation). o Training__c ‚Üí Represents training sessions/workshops. o Job__c ‚Üí Represents job roles requiring skills.

Procedure for my reference:

Object Record Types Purpose Job Full-Time, Internship Separate hiring processes Training Technical, Soft Skills Different course categories Candidate Fresher, Experience Different Job Roles

5.Page Layouts

ÔÅ∂ They control which fields, sections, buttons, and related lists appear on a record detail/edit page. ÔÅ∂ Combined with Record Types, they allow different users to see different layouts for the same object.

o Controls fields, related lists, buttons visibility for users. o Example: For Job__c, HR users see "Salary" field, while external partners only see "Role Description".

Procedure to Create Page Layouts

o Go to Setup ‚Üí Object Manager ‚Üí Select Object (e.g., Job) ‚Üí Page Layouts.

o Click New ‚Üí clone the default layout. o Rename it (e.g., Full-Time Job Layout).

o Drag & drop fields to rearrange sections: ‚Ä¢ Create sections like Job Details, Requirements, etc.

‚Ä¢ Add relevant fields to each. ‚Ä¢ Assign the Page Layout to the correct Record Type. ‚Ä¢ Example: Full-Time Job ‚Üí Full-Time Layout. ‚Ä¢ Internship ‚Üí Internship Layout.

Job Object Layouts
ÔÇß Full-Time Job Layout ÔÇß Fields: Job Title, Department, Location, Required Experience, Job Description. ÔÇß Internship Layout ÔÇß Fields: Job Title, Department, Location, Duration (instead of Required Experience), Job Description.

Object Record Type Page Layout Assigned Job Full-Time Full-Time Job Layout Job Internship Internship Job Layout Training Technical Technical Training Layout Training Soft Skills Soft Skills Layout Candidate Fresher Fresher Layout Candidate Experience Experienced Layout

Compact Layouts
‚Ä¢ Compact Layouts decide which key fields are visible at the top of a record page (the Highlights Panel) and in the Salesforce Mobile App. ‚Ä¢ They show the most important information without opening the record fully. Example: For a Job record, instead of opening the whole page, you can quickly see: Job Title, Department, Location, Required Experience.

‚Ä¢ Define which fields are visible in highlights panel (mobile & Lightning). ‚Ä¢ Example: For Skill__c, show ‚Üí Skill Name, Level, Certification Status.

Procedure to Create a Compact Layout

Go to Setup ‚Üí Object Manager ‚Üí Select Object (e.g., Job).

Schema Builder Schema Builder allows you to see your objects, fields, and relationships graphically, and also create/edit objects/fields directly using drag-and-drop.
o Visual tool to create/view objects and relationships. o Helps in validating ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram).

Step-by-Step: Schema Builder

Open Schema Builder ‚Ä¢ Go to Setup ‚Üí Quick Find ‚Üí type Schema Builder ‚Üí Click it. ‚Ä¢ You‚Äôll see: ‚Ä¢ Canvas (middle): where objects will appear. ‚Ä¢ Elements Panel (left): drag-and-drop tools. ‚Ä¢ Filters Panel (right): choose which objects to display.
Show Your Objects ‚Ä¢ In the Filter Panel, tick: ‚Ä¢ Your Custom Objects: Student, Trainer, Skill, Training, Enrollment. ‚Ä¢ Standard objects you may use (Account, Contact, User). ‚Ä¢ Objects appear as boxes on the canvas, with their fields inside.
Drag & Drop (Inside Objects) ‚Ä¢ From the Elements Panel (left), drag a Field Type (e.g., Text, Number, Date, Checkbox). ‚Ä¢ Drop it into the desired object box (like Student).
‚Ä¢ A popup will open ‚Üí Configure field details: ‚Ä¢ Field Label (e.g., "Student Email"). ‚Ä¢ Field Name (auto-fills). ‚Ä¢ Type & Properties (length, required, default value). ‚Ä¢ Click Save ‚Üí The field now shows inside the object box.

Adjust Canvas ‚Ä¢ You can move object boxes around (drag the whole object box). ‚Ä¢ Resize canvas using zoom controls (bottom left). ‚Ä¢ This helps you arrange objects neatly for documentation.
Customize Display On the Schema Builder toolbar (top right): ‚Ä¢ Show Required Fields ‚Üí highlights required ones. ‚Ä¢ Show Relationship Fields ‚Üí we will use this later in next step. ‚Ä¢ Hide Standard Fields ‚Üí keeps canvas cleaner. ‚Ä¢
Relationships This is one of the most important parts of data modeling because it defines how objects connect with each other in Salesforce.
Types of Relationships

Lookup Relationship ‚Ä¢ Loose connection between objects. ‚Ä¢ Child record can exist without parent. ‚Ä¢ Example: A Skill record linked to a Student (but can exist even if no student is assigned).
Master-Detail Relationship ‚Ä¢ Strong connection (parent-child). ‚Ä¢ Child record cannot exist without parent. ‚Ä¢ Parent controls child record‚Äôs lifecycle, ownership, and sharing. ‚Ä¢ Example: Enrollment (child) must belong to a Student (parent).
Hierarchical Relationship ‚Ä¢ Only available on User object. ‚Ä¢ Used to link users to managers (self-relationship). ‚Ä¢ Example: User ‚Üí Manager reporting. ‚Ä¢ (Only possible on User object ‚Üí usually for reporting lines, e.g., Manager field). ‚Ä¢ Hierarchical is Not required for my current model,
Steps in Schema Builder

Create a Lookup Relationship ‚Ä¢ In Schema Builder ‚Üí drag Lookup Relationship from left panel. ‚Ä¢ Drop it into the child object box (e.g., Training).
‚Ä¢ Popup appears: ‚Ä¢ Related To: Trainer. ‚Ä¢ Field Label: "Trainer Name". ‚Ä¢ Save ‚Üí A line appears between Training and Trainer.

Create a Master-Detail Relationship ‚Ä¢ Drag Master-Detail Relationship ‚Üí Drop into Enrollment. ‚Ä¢ Popup appears: ‚Ä¢ Related To: Student. ‚Ä¢ Field Label: "Student Name". ‚Ä¢ Save ‚Üí Line shows Enrollment ‚Üí Student. ‚Ä¢ Repeat for Enrollment ‚Üí Training.

Arrange Schema ‚Ä¢ Drag object boxes on canvas so relationships are clearly visible: ‚Ä¢ Put Student and Training at top. ‚Ä¢ Place Enrollment in middle as junction. ‚Ä¢ Keep Trainer near Training. ‚Ä¢ Place Skill near Student.

Junction Objects
‚Ä¢ Used for many-to-many relationships. ‚Ä¢ Example: ‚Ä¢ JobSkill__c ‚Üí Junction between Job__c and Skill__c. ‚Ä¢ Allows a job to require multiple skills and one skill to belong to multiple jobs. Job__c ‚Üî JobSkill__c ‚Üî Skill__c

‚Ä¢ A junction object is a custom object used to create a many-to-many relationship between two objects. ‚Ä¢ It achieves this by having two Master-Detail relationships, one for each parent.

Enrollment is the junction object. ‚Ä¢ Why? ‚Ä¢ A Student can enroll in many Trainings. ‚Ä¢ A Training can have many Students. ‚Ä¢ To handle this many-to-many relationship ‚Üí Enrollment is required.

Here Enrollment acts as a Junction Object

External Objects
Used to integrate data outside Salesforce (via OData). Example: ‚Ä¢ External_Training__x ‚Üí Connects Salesforce to an external LMS (Learning Management System). ‚Ä¢ External_Translation__x ‚Üí Connects Salesforce to AI Translation API logs.

‚Ä¢ External Objects let Salesforce connect to data stored outside Salesforce (in external systems). ‚Ä¢ They are similar to custom objects but their records live in another system (not in Salesforce DB). ‚Ä¢ Accessed in Salesforce using Salesforce Connect. ‚Ä¢ Currently I‚Äôm not using it might use in upcoming phase if required

Documentation Deliverables For Phase 3, include: ‚Ä¢ Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) ‚Üí Show Standard & Custom Objects + relationships. ‚Ä¢ Custom Object & Field Tables ‚Üí Name, API Name, Type, Description. ‚Ä¢ Record Type & Layout Mapping ‚Üí Which record types use which layouts. ‚Ä¢ Junction Object Mapping ‚Üí Many-to-many relationships. ‚Ä¢ Screenshots: Schema Builder, Page Layout, Compact Layout.
Benefits of This Phase
ÔÅ∂ Ensures clear business data structure. ÔÅ∂ Enables automation (Flows, Triggers, Validation Rules) later. ÔÅ∂ Supports reporting and dashboards. ÔÅ∂ Prepares data model for scalability & integrations.

ÔÅ∂ Setup security, login policies, and sharing models. ÔÅ∂ Prepared sandbox & deployment plan.

Phase 4: Process Automation (Admin)

Introduction In this phase, we implemented automation features in Salesforce to streamline the workflow of our Skill Development & Employment Portal. The goal was to minimize manual tasks, improve accuracy, and ensure timely notifications for users (Students, Employers, Trainers, and Admins). Salesforce provides multiple tools for process automation, and we applied them to enforce business rules, trigger actions, and guide the overall process.

Step 1 ‚Äî Preparing org and create test data (required before automation) Purpose: enable email delivery & notifications and create sample records you‚Äôll use to test all automations (Job, Training, Student, Employer, Application). in my Trailhead Playground (Lightning Experience):

Launch Playground / Dev Org ‚Ä¢ Go to Trailhead ‚Üí click your avatar ‚Üí Hands-on Orgs / Launch your Trailhead Playground (or open your Developer Edition org). ‚Ä¢ Confirm you're in the right org (org name shown in the top-right). ‚Ä¢ (Why): all configuration and screenshots must be done inside the org where you‚Äôll build automations.
Open Setup ‚Ä¢ Click the Gear (‚öôÔ∏è) icon ‚Üí Setup.
Enable Email Deliverability (so email alerts actually send) ‚Ä¢ In Setup Quick Find, type Deliverability ‚Üí open Deliverability. ‚Ä¢ Set Access Level (or Access to Send Email) to All Email ‚Üí Save.
‚Ä¢ Why: Email Alerts use your org‚Äôs deliverability setting ‚Äî Trailhead orgs default to ‚ÄúSystem email only‚Äù which blocks test emails.

Create 2 simple Lightning Email Templates (you‚Äôll wire these to Email Alerts later) ‚Ä¢ In Setup Quick Find, type Email Templates ‚Üí Email Templates. ‚Ä¢ Click New Email Template (Lightning). Create: ‚Ä¢ Template 1 ‚Ä¢ Name: Job Application ‚Äì To Employer ‚Ä¢ Subject: New application for: {!Job__c.Name} (replace merge field with your Job field if different) ‚Ä¢ Body: short message: ‚ÄúA new candidate has applied. Applicant: {!Contact.Name}. Job: {!Job__c.Name}. View the application: {!Record.Link}‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Template 2 ‚Ä¢ Name: Application Status ‚Äì To Student ‚Ä¢ Subject: Your application status for {!Job__c.Name} ‚Ä¢ Body: ‚ÄúHi {!Contact.FirstName}, your application status is now: {!Application__c.Status__c}.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ Save templates. (You don‚Äôt need perfect merge fields now ‚Äî placeholders are fine; we‚Äôll fix exact merge fields when wiring alerts.)

Create Custom Notification Types (for in-app notifications) ‚Ä¢ In Setup Quick Find, type Notification Builder ‚Üí open Custom Notifications. ‚Ä¢ Click New and create two types: ‚Ä¢ New Application (API name New_Application) ‚Äî Channels: Desktop & Mobile (select available channels). ‚Ä¢ Application Status Changed (API name Application_Status_Changed) ‚Äî Channels: Desktop & Mobile. ‚Ä¢ Save.

Create sample test records (so automations can be tested) ‚Ä¢ Use App Launcher (grid icon) ‚Üí search for your custom objects (e.g., Jobs, Trainings, Applications, Contacts). ‚Ä¢ Create: ‚Ä¢ Employer Account (Accounts) ‚Äî e.g., Acme Hiring ‚Ä¢ Contact / Student ‚Äî e.g., Rupa Sree (email a working email you control for testing) ‚Ä¢ Job Posting ‚Äî Title: Frontend Developer - Test, Location: Hyderabad, Salary Range: 20,000‚Äì40,000, Closing Date: (choose a future date) ‚Ä¢ Training Program ‚Äî Name: Full-Stack Bootcamp Test, Start Date: choose date ‚Ä¢ Job Application ‚Äî Link Applicant (Contact) to Job Posting, Status = Pending ‚Ä¢ Save each record.

Automation Components Validation Rules o Purpose: Ensure data integrity by restricting incorrect or incomplete data entry. o Examples in Project: o Prevent students from registering without entering a valid email and phone number. o Ensure that job postings must include Salary Range and Job Location. o Block duplicate skill names in the Skills object. o Validation Rules ensure users enter correct data before saving records. In our Skill Development & Employment Portal, we‚Äôll create rules like: o Students must enter a valid Email address o Job Posting must include Salary Range

üîπ Procedure (do this in my Trailhead Playground): Rule 1: Candidate Email Validation

Go to Setup ‚Üí Quick Find: Object Manager.
Select your Candidate(Contact) object (if you‚Äôre using Contact for students).
In the left panel, click Validation Rules ‚Üí New.
Enter: ‚Ä¢ Rule Name: Valid_Email ‚Ä¢ Error Condition Formula: ‚Ä¢ NOT(REGEX( Email , "^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,4}$")) ‚Ä¢ Error Message: Enter valid email ‚Ä¢ Error Location: Field ‚Üí Email.
Save.
Rule 2: Job Posting Salary Range Required

In Object Manager, open your Job (custom object).
Go to Validation Rules ‚Üí New.
Enter: ‚Ä¢ Rule Name: Salary_Range_Required ‚Ä¢ Error Condition Formula: ‚Ä¢ ISBLANK( Salary_Range__c ) ‚Ä¢ Error Message: Salary Range must be provided for all job postings. ‚Ä¢ Error Location: Field ‚Üí Salary Range.
Save.
üîπ Testing the Rules

Go to App Launcher ‚Üí open Students (Contacts). ‚Ä¢ Try creating a new student record with an invalid email (e.g., test@abc). ‚Ä¢ Confirm Salesforce blocks the save and shows your error message.

Go to Job Postings ‚Üí create a new job posting without entering Salary Range. ‚Ä¢ Confirm Salesforce blocks save and shows your error message.

Workflow Rules
o Purpose: Automate simple ‚Äúif-then‚Äù actions based on record changes. o Examples in Project: o When a Job Application is submitted, send an email alert to the employer. o If a training session is updated with a new schedule, notify registered students. ÔÉò Workflow Rules help you send alerts, update fields, or create tasks automatically when conditions are met. ÔÉò For our Skill Development & Employment Portal, let‚Äôs build one:

üîπ Use Case Example: Notify Employer when a Job Application is Submitted When a student submits a new Job Application, the employer should immediately get an Email Alert. Procedure

Go to Setup ‚Üí Quick Find: Workflow Rules.
Click New Rule.
Select Object: Job (your custom object).
Click Next.
Enter: ‚Ä¢ Rule Name: Notify_Employer_New_Application ‚Ä¢ Evaluation Criteria: created (Evaluate the rule when a record is created). ‚Ä¢ Rule Criteria: ‚Ä¢ Field: Application Status ‚Ä¢ Operator: equals ‚Ä¢ Value: Pending
‚Ä¢ Click Save & Next.

In Workflow Actions, click Add Workflow Action ‚Üí New Email Alert.

Enter: ‚Ä¢ Description: New Job Application Alert to Employer ‚Ä¢ Email Template: Select Job Application ‚Äì To Employer (we created in Step 1). ‚Ä¢ Recipients: Add Employer Email (lookup field on Job Posting ‚Üí Employer ‚Üí Contact Email). ‚Ä¢ Save.

Click Done.
On Workflow Rules list ‚Üí select your new rule.
Click Activate.
Testing the Workflow Rule

Go to App Launcher ‚Üí Open Job Applications

Create a new Job Application for a Student ‚Üí choose Job Posting ‚Üí set Status = Pending.

Save.

Check the Employer‚Äôs email inbox (or if testing with your email, check your inbox)

‚Ä¢ Workflow Rule detail page (showing criteria + email action). ‚Ä¢ Email received in inbox.

Process Builder
‚Ä¢ Purpose: Build more advanced automation with multiple conditions and actions. ‚Ä¢ Examples in Project: ‚Ä¢ Automatically assign a status = "Pending Review" when a new Job Application is submitted. ‚Ä¢ Create a Task for Admin when a new Training Program is added. ‚Ä¢ Send a Custom Notification to students when their application status changes. Why Process Builder? Workflow Rules are limited (one action at a time). Process Builder allows multiple conditions + multiple actions in a single automation. For our Skill Development & Employment Portal, we‚Äôll build a process that:

When a Job Application is created or updated, ‚Ä¢ Automatically set its Status = ‚ÄúPending Review‚Äù. ‚Ä¢ Create a Task for Admin to review the application. ‚Ä¢ Send a Custom Notification to the student.
üîπ Procedure

Create New Process

Go to Setup ‚Üí Quick Find: Process Builder.

‚Ä¢ Action Type: Create a Record. ‚Ä¢ Name: Create_Admin_Review_Task. ‚Ä¢ Record Type: Task. ‚Ä¢ Set Fields: ‚Ä¢ Subject = Review New Job Application ‚Ä¢ Assigned To = Admin User (lookup your username if you‚Äôre Admin). ‚Ä¢ Status = Not Started ‚Ä¢ Priority = High. ‚Ä¢ Save.

(C) Send Custom Notification to Student

‚Ä¢ Action Type: Send Custom Notification. ‚Ä¢ Name: Notify_Student_Application. ‚Ä¢ Notification Type = Application Status Changed (from Step 1). ‚Ä¢ Recipient: Student (Contact) related to the application. ‚Ä¢ Title = Your job application has been received! ‚Ä¢ Body = Your application is now under review. ‚Ä¢ Save.

Activate the Process

‚Ä¢ Click Activate at the top.

üîπ Testing the Process

Go to Job Applications ‚Üí create a new record. ‚Ä¢ Student = (pick your test Contact). ‚Ä¢ Job Posting = (pick your test Job). ‚Ä¢ Status = Pending. ‚Ä¢ Save.
Verify Results: ‚Ä¢ The Status auto-updates to Pending Review. ‚Ä¢ A Task is created and assigned to Admin. ‚Ä¢ The Student receives a custom notification (check bell icon in Salesforce).
Auto updated as pending review

Approval Process
o Purpose: Automate record approval workflows. o Examples in Project: o Employers‚Äô job postings go through an Admin approval process before being visible to students. o Training programs created by trainers require approval before publishing. o Why Approval Process? It ensures that important records (like Job Postings or Training Programs) go through proper review before becoming active. For our Skill Development & Employment Portal, let‚Äôs create one for Job Postings: ‚Ä¢ Employer submits a Job Posting. ‚Ä¢ Admin reviews & approves. ‚Ä¢ If approved ‚Üí Status = ‚ÄúApproved‚Äù. ‚Ä¢ If rejected ‚Üí Status = ‚ÄúRejected‚Äù. ‚Ä¢ Employer gets email notification.

üîπ Procedure

Create Approval Process

Go to Setup ‚Üí Quick Find: Approval Processes.
Click Approval Process Wizard ‚Üí Jump Start Wizard (simpler for demo).
Select Object: Job Posting.
Enter: ‚Ä¢ Name: Job_Posting_Approval ‚Ä¢ Unique Name: auto-filled. ‚Ä¢ Entry Criteria: Status equals Submitted ‚Ä¢ Approver: Automatically assign to user ‚Üí Select Admin (your user). ‚Ä¢ Email Template: Use a Job Approval template (you can reuse Job Application ‚Äì To Employer template, or create a new one like Job Posting Approval Notification). ‚Ä¢ Save.
Add Field Updates We‚Äôll set Status field to change based on outcome.

In Approval Process ‚Üí Click Final Approval Actions ‚Üí Add New ‚Üí Field Update. ‚Ä¢ Name: Set_Status_Approved. ‚Ä¢ Object: Job Posting. ‚Ä¢ Field: Status. ‚Ä¢ Value: Approved. ‚Ä¢ Save.

On the record detail page ‚Üí click Submit for Approval.
Login as Admin (your user should already be approver). ‚Ä¢ Open the Approval Request. ‚Ä¢ Click Approve. ‚Ä¢ Confirm Status field = Approved.
Flow Builder
Salesforce Flows allowed us to create more advanced automations, including screens, record-triggered actions, and scheduled tasks. ‚Ä¢ Screen Flow: Guided student registration with conditional questions (e.g., education background). ‚Ä¢ Record-Triggered Flow: When a job is closed, automatically update related applications to "Not Selected". ‚Ä¢ Scheduled Flow: Send reminders to students about upcoming training sessions. ‚Ä¢ Auto-Launched Flow: Auto-assign default skills to new students upon registration.

Step 6: Flow Builder ‚Äî the most powerful automation tool in Salesforce. We‚Äôll do this step-by-step with four types of Flows:

Record-Triggered Flow ‚Üí auto actions when a record changes.
Screen Flow ‚Üí guided wizard for users.
Scheduled Flow ‚Üí runs on a schedule.
Auto-launched Flow ‚Üí called by other automation (Process Builder, Apex). ________________________________________Use Case: When a Job Application is Approved, automatically: ‚Ä¢ Enroll the Student into a default Training Program. ‚Ä¢ Send them a notification.
üîπ Procedure

Go to Flow Builder ‚Ä¢ Setup ‚Üí Quick Find: Flows ‚Üí Click New Flow. ‚Ä¢ Select Record-Triggered Flow. ‚Ä¢ Object = Job Application. ‚Ä¢ Trigger = When a record is updated. ‚Ä¢ Condition = Status equals Approved. ‚Ä¢ Optimize for = Actions and Related Records. ‚Ä¢ Click Done.

Add Action: Send Notification ‚Ä¢ Click + ‚Üí Action. ‚Ä¢ Action Type = Send Custom Notification. ‚Ä¢ Label = Notify Student. ‚Ä¢ Notification Type = Application Status Changed. ‚Ä¢ Recipient = {!$Record.Student__c}. ‚Ä¢ Title = Congrats! ‚Ä¢ Body = You have been enrolled in the training program. ‚Ä¢ Save.
Save & Activate Flow ‚Ä¢ Flow Label: Auto_Enroll_Student_On_Approval. ‚Ä¢ Save ‚Üí Activate.
üîπ Testing

Go to Job Applications ‚Üí Pick one with Status = Pending Review.
Update Status = Approved ‚Üí Save.
Check: ‚Ä¢ Student auto-enrolled in Training (new Training Enrollment record created). ‚Ä¢ Student receives Notification in Salesforce (bell icon).
Email Alerts
o Used to send automated emails for different actions: o Job Application submitted ‚Üí Employer notified. o Training Program approved ‚Üí Trainer notified. o Application accepted ‚Üí Student notified. Objective o To send automatic email notifications to users when specific conditions are met. o In our project use case (Skill Development Employment Portal): ‚Ä¢ When a Candidate is shortlisted for a Job, send them an automated email. ‚Ä¢ When a Job Application is Rejected, send a rejection email. ‚Ä¢ When a Training Enrollment is Approved, send confirmation to the Candidate.

üîπ Procedure

Step 1: Create an Email Template

In Salesforce Setup, go to App Launcher ‚Üí Search ‚ÄúEmail Templates‚Äù ‚Üí New Email Template.
Enter details: ‚Ä¢ Email Template Name: Candidate Shortlist Notification ‚Ä¢ Subject: Congratulations! You have been shortlisted ‚Ä¢ Email Body: ‚Ä¢ Hello {!Candidate__c.Name}, ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Congratulations! You have been shortlisted for the job: {!Job__c.Name}.
‚Ä¢ Please log in to the portal for next steps.
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Regards,
‚Ä¢ Skill Development Employment Portal Team ‚Ä¢ Save.
Step 2: Create an Email Alert

In Setup, search Email Alerts ‚Üí New Email Alert.
Fill details: ‚Ä¢ Description: Notify Candidate when Shortlisted ‚Ä¢ Email Template: Candidate Shortlist Notificat ‚Ä¢ ion ‚Ä¢ Recipient Type: Select Related User ‚Üí Candidate Email field ‚Ä¢ Save.
Step 3: Add Email Alert to Automation You can attach this Email Alert to: ‚Ä¢ Workflow Rule (when Job Application Status = Shortlisted) ‚Ä¢ Process Builder (if we want more conditions, e.g., Skill Match ‚â• 80%) ‚Ä¢ Flow Builder (for advanced logic, e.g., send both Candidate & Recruiter emails). Use Case When a Job Application‚Äôs Status = Shortlisted, the candidate automatically receives the shortlist notification email.

üîπ Step-by-Step Procedure Step 1: Go to Workflow Rules

In Setup, search for Workflow Rules.
Click New Rule.
Step 2: Choose Object

Select Job Application (Custom Object) (assuming you created this in earlier phases).
Click Next.
Step 3: Define Rule Criteria

Rule Name: Shortlist Notification Rule
Evaluation Criteria: created, and every time it‚Äôs edited
Rule Criteria: ‚Ä¢ Field: Status ‚Ä¢ Operator: equals ‚Ä¢ Value: Shortlisted
Save & Next.
Step 4: Add Workflow Action ‚Üí Email Alert

Under Immediate Workflow Actions, click Add Workflow Action ‚Üí New Email Alert.

‚Üì
Email Alert ‚Üí Sends ‚ÄúYou are shortlisted‚Äù email to Candidate

Now, whenever a recruiter updates a candidate‚Äôs application to Shortlisted, the system will send an automated email üéâ

Field Updates
‚Ä¢ Automated field updates to reduce manual work: ‚Ä¢ Application Status auto-updates from "Pending" ‚Üí "Under Review" ‚Üí "Accepted/Rejected". ‚Ä¢ Job Posting status auto-updates to "Expired" after the closing date.

Objective Field Updates allow us to automatically update a field‚Äôs value when certain conditions are met. This reduces manual work and ensures data consistency.

üîπ Use Case in Project In the Skill Development Employment Portal, let‚Äôs implement: ‚Ä¢ When a Job Application Status = Selected, automatically update the Placement Status field on the Candidate record to Placed. This way, admins and recruiters don‚Äôt need to manually mark a candidate as ‚ÄúPlaced.‚Äù

üîπ Step-by-Step Procedure Step 1: Go to Workflow Rules

In Setup, search for Workflow Rules.
Click New Rule.
Select Job Application (Custom Object).
Click Next.
Step 2: Define Rule Criteria

Rule Name: Placement Update Rule
Evaluation Criteria: created, and every time it‚Äôs edited
Rule Criteria: ‚Ä¢ Field: Status ‚Ä¢ Operator: equals ‚Ä¢ Value: Selected

‚Üì
Field Update ‚Üí Candidate.Placement_Status = "Placed"

This ensures automatic synchronization between job application status and candidate placement status. We already saw this field updates in our earlier steps while creating workflow rules

Tasks
‚Ä¢ Automated Task creation for Admins and Trainers: ‚Ä¢ Admin gets a task to review new Job Postings. ‚Ä¢ Trainer gets a task to prepare study materials when a new Training Session is created.

Objective Tasks allow Salesforce to automatically create to-do items for users (Recruiters, Admins, Trainers, etc.) when specific conditions are met. This ensures no important step is missed.

üîπ Use Case in Project In the Skill Development Employment Portal, let‚Äôs implement: ‚Ä¢ When a Candidate applies for a Job, automatically create a Task for the Recruiter to review the application. This helps recruiters stay on top of new applications.

üîπ Step-by-Step Procedure

Step 1: Go to Workflow Rules

In Setup, search Workflow Rules.
Click New Rule.
Select Job Application (Custom Object).
Click Next.
Step 2: Define Rule Criteria

Rule Name: Candidate Application Task Rule
Evaluation Criteria: created
Rule Criteria: ‚Ä¢ Field: Status ‚Ä¢ Operator: equals ‚Ä¢ Value: Applied
Save & Next.
Step 3: Add Workflow Action ‚Üí New Task

Under Immediate Workflow Actions, click Add Workflow Action ‚Üí New Task.

Fill details: ‚Ä¢ Assigned To: Recruiter (Related User or specific role) ‚Ä¢ Subject: Review New Candidate Application ‚Ä¢ Due Date: Rule Trigger Date + 2 Days ‚Ä¢ Priority: High ‚Ä¢ Status: Not Started

Step 4: Activate the Workflow

Click Activate.
Done ‚úÖ
üîπ Workflow Flow Diagram Job Application Created (Status = Applied)
‚Üì
Workflow Rule Triggers
‚Üì
Task Created for Recruiter: "Review Candidate Application"

This ensures that every application gets recruiter attention without delay.

Custom Notifications
‚Ä¢ In-App Notifications were configured for real-time alerts: ‚Ä¢ Student receives a notification when their application is shortlisted. ‚Ä¢ Employer gets a notification when a new candidate applies. Objective Custom Notifications allow Salesforce to send real-time alerts directly inside the Salesforce app (web or mobile), instead of only through email. This keeps users (Recruiters, Admins, Trainers, Candidates) informed immediately.

üîπ Use Case in Project In the Skill Development Employment Portal, let‚Äôs implement: ‚Ä¢ When a Candidate is Placed in a Job, send a Custom Notification to the Recruiter and Admin saying: ‚ÄúCandidate [Name] has been successfully placed in [Job Title].‚Äù This makes the platform more interactive and responsive.

üîπ Step-by-Step Procedure

Step 1: Enable Custom Notifications

Go to Setup ‚Üí Search Notification Builder ‚Üí Click Notification Types.
Click New. ‚Ä¢ Label: Placement Success Notification ‚Ä¢ API Name: Placement_Success_Notification ‚Ä¢ Supported Channels: Desktop + Mobile
Save.
Step 2: Create Process/Flow to Trigger Notification

Go to Setup ‚Üí Flow Builder (recommended instead of Workflow for Custom Notifications).
Create a Record-Triggered Flow on Job Application (Custom Object).
Entry Criteria: ‚Ä¢ Field: Status ‚Ä¢ Operator: equals ‚Ä¢ Value: Selected
Add an Action ‚Üí Send Custom Notification. ‚Ä¢ Notification Type: Placement Success Notification ‚Ä¢ Recipient: Recruiter (Related User) + Admin Role ‚Ä¢ Notification Title: Candidate Placement Update ‚Ä¢ Notification Body: Candidate {!Candidate__c.Name} has been placed in Job {!Job__c.Name}.
Save & Activate.
Step 3: Test It

Process Automation Phase (Admin) is complete: ‚Ä¢ Validation Rules ‚Ä¢ Workflow Rules ‚Ä¢ Process Builder ‚Ä¢ Approval Process ‚Ä¢ Flow Builder ‚Ä¢ Email Alerts ‚Ä¢ Field Updates ‚Ä¢ Tasks ‚Ä¢ Custom Notifications

Benefits of Process Automation in the Project ‚Ä¢ Reduced manual effort for Admins and Trainers. ‚Ä¢ Faster response times for students and employers. ‚Ä¢ Ensured data accuracy through validation rules. ‚Ä¢ Improved user experience with timely notifications. ‚Ä¢ Standardized approval flows to maintain quality.

Phase 5: Apex Programming (Developer)

üîπ Objective In this phase, we extend the portal‚Äôs functionality using Apex programming. While earlier phases focused on data modeling and automation, this phase introduces custom logic for: o Managing skills and training (Skill Development) o Automating job applications and employer workflows (Employment) o Handling large-scale data using asynchronous processing This ensures that both Skill Development and Employment Management are deeply integrated into the portal.

üîπ Apex Components

Apex Classes & Objects o SkillManager.cls ‚Üí Assigns skills to candidates after training completion. o TrainingEnrollment.cls ‚Üí Handles candidate enrollment into training programs. o JobApplicationHandler.cls ‚Üí Validates and processes job applications. o EmployerHelper.cls ‚Üí Helps recruiters filter candidates by skills and certifications. Step 1: Implementing SkillManager.cls Purpose in your project This class will allow you to assign skills to candidates once they complete a training program. For example: ‚Ä¢ Candidate Rupa finishes "Java Full Stack" training. ‚Ä¢ System automatically assigns "Java Full Stack" skill to Rupa‚Äôs profile.
üõ†Ô∏è Step 1A: Make sure custom objects exist Before coding, check that these objects exist in your org:

Candidate__c ‚Äì stores candidate details (like Name, Email, Phone, etc.)
Skill__c ‚Äì stores skill details (like Skill Name, Candidate reference, Certification, etc.) üëâ Procedure: ‚Ä¢ Go to Setup ‚Üí Object Manager. ‚Ä¢ Check if Candidate__c and Skill__c exist. ‚Ä¢ If not, create them: ‚Ä¢ Candidate__c ‚Üí Fields: Name (standard), Email, Phone.
‚Ä¢ Skill__c ‚Üí Fields: Name (standard), Lookup ‚Üí Candidate__c.

üõ†Ô∏è Step 1B: Create Apex Class in Developer Console

In Salesforce, click your avatar (top right).
Select Developer Console.
Go to File ‚Üí New ‚Üí Apex Class.
Enter name: SkillManager.
üõ†Ô∏è Step 1C: Test the Class (Execute Anonymous Window)

In Developer Console ‚Üí Press Ctrl + E (Execute Anonymous).
Run this test code: // Example: Assign "Java Programming" skill to a Candidate Id testCandidateId = 'PUT_A_VALID_CANDIDATE_ID_HERE'; SkillManager.assignSkill(testCandidateId, 'Java Programming'); üëâ Replace PUT_A_VALID_CANDIDATE_ID_HERE with an actual Candidate__c Id from your org. ‚Ä¢ To find this, go to App Launcher ‚Üí Candidates ‚Üí open a candidate record ‚Üí copy the Id from URL.
üõ†Ô∏è Step 1D: Verify the Result

Go to App Launcher ‚Üí Skills tab.
You should see a new Skill record created, linked to that Candidate.
Apex Triggers o CandidateTrigger (before insert) ‚Üí Validate unique email & phone. o TrainingEnrollmentTrigger (after insert) ‚Üí Update candidate‚Äôs ‚ÄúSkills Acquired‚Äù after course completion. o JobApplicationTrigger (after update) ‚Üí Auto-reject if required skills are missing. o Step 1: Verify Objects & Fields

Training__c ‚Ä¢ Candidate__c ‚Üí Lookup(Candidate__c) ‚Ä¢ Training_Status__c ‚Üí Picklist (values: Completed, In Progress) ‚Ä¢ Training_Name__c ‚Üí Text

Skill__c ‚Ä¢ Skill_Name__c ‚Üí Text (name of skill) ‚Ä¢ Candidate__c ‚Üí Lookup(Candidate__c)

‚úÖ Make sure these fields exist.

Step 2: Create Apex Helper Class Go to Setup ‚Üí Apex Classes ‚Üí New and create SkillAssignmentHelper.cls:

Step 3: Create the Trigger

Go to Setup ‚Üí Object Manager ‚Üí Training__c ‚Üí Triggers ‚Üí New
Enter: trigger AssignSkillAfterTraining on Training__c (after update) { SkillAssignmentHelper.assignSkillsAfterTraining(Trigger.new, Trigger.oldMap); } ‚úÖ This ensures your trigger is bulk-safe and clean.
Step 4: Test the Trigger

Open a Training__c record for a candidate.

Change Training_Status__c from In Progress ‚Üí Completed.

Save the record.

Go to the candidate record ‚Üí check the Skills related list. You should see a new Skill__c record created automatically.

Step 5: Test Class (for Deployment)

Summary

Using Training__c instead of Training_Enrollment__c.
Using Skill_Name__c instead of Name for Skill__c.
Trigger fires after update and inserts skills when training is completed.
Trigger Design Pattern A Trigger Design Pattern is a way to structure your Apex triggers so they are: ‚Ä¢ Bulk-safe ‚Äì handles multiple records at once ‚Ä¢ Readable and maintainable ‚Äì logic is separated from the trigger ‚Ä¢ Reusable ‚Äì can call helper classes for different operations Why it‚Äôs needed: Without a design pattern, your triggers can become messy and cause: ‚Ä¢ DML limits errors ‚Ä¢ Hard-to-maintain code ‚Ä¢ Duplicate logic
2Ô∏è‚É£ Common Trigger Design Pattern Structure

Trigger ‚Äì only contains calls to a handler class
Handler class ‚Äì contains methods like beforeInsert, afterInsert, beforeUpdate, afterUpdate
Separation of concerns ‚Äì triggers don‚Äôt directly perform business logic Example Structure: // Trigger trigger TrainingTrigger on Training__c (before insert, after update) { if(Trigger.isBefore && Trigger.isInsert) { TrainingHandler.beforeInsert(Trigger.new); } if(Trigger.isAfter && Trigger.isUpdate) { TrainingHandler.afterUpdate(Trigger.new, Trigger.oldMap); } } // Handler Class public class TrainingHandler { public static void beforeInsert(List<Training__c> newTrainings) { // Logic before insert } public static void afterUpdate(List<Training__c> updatedTrainings, Map<Id, Training__c> oldMap) { for(Training__c t : updatedTrainings) { Training__c oldT = oldMap.get(t.Id); if(t.Training_Status__c == 'Completed' && oldT.Training_Status__c != 'Completed') { Skill__c skill = new Skill__c( Candidate__c = t.Candidate__c, Skill_Name__c = t.Training_Name__c ); insert skill; } } } }
3Ô∏è‚É£ Benefits ‚Ä¢ Bulk-safe: handles multiple Training__c records at once ‚Ä¢ Easy to maintain: business logic is in the handler, not in the trigger ‚Ä¢ Scalable: easy to extend for other objects like Job applications

4Ô∏è‚É£ Implement in our Project

Create the Handler Class ‚Ä¢ Go to Setup ‚Üí Apex Classes ‚Üí New ‚Ä¢ Name it TrainingHandler ‚Ä¢ Paste the TrainingHandler code of it

Create the Trigger ‚Ä¢ Go to Setup ‚Üí Object Manager ‚Üí Training__c ‚Üí Triggers ‚Üí New ‚Ä¢ Name it TrainingTrigger ‚Ä¢ Paste the trigger code

Test the Trigger ‚Ä¢ Use the anonymous Apex script we wrote earlier, or the test class ‚Ä¢ Update Training_Status__c to Completed ‚Ä¢ Verify a Skill__c record is automatically created

o All triggers delegate logic to Handler Classes. o Example: JobApplicationTrigger ‚Üí JobApplicationHandler.cls. o Ensures scalability and easy maintenance.

SOQL & SOSL Queries o SOQL: Fetch candidates with specific skills for a given job. o SOSL: Search courses or certifications across multiple objects quickly.
SOQL lets you fetch records from your custom objects (Candidate, Skill, Job, Training).

Step 1: Open Developer Console

Log in to Salesforce.
In the top-right corner ‚Üí Click on your avatar ‚Üí Developer Console.
Developer Console opens in a new window.
Step 2: Run a Simple SOQL Query

In Developer Console ‚Üí Go to Query Editor (bottom tab).
Type this query: SELECT Id, Email__c, Education__c FROM Candidate__c
Click Execute.
You will now see all Candidate records with their Email & Education in a table.
Step 3: Run SOQL Inside Apex (Execute Anonymous)

In Developer Console ‚Üí Debug ‚Üí Open Execute Anonymous Window (Ctrl+E).

Paste this code: List<Candidate__c> candidates = [ SELECT Id, Email__c, Education__c, Place__c FROM Candidate__c ]; System.debug('Candidate Records: ' + candidates);

Tick ‚úÖ Open Log ‚Üí Click Execute.

In the log window ‚Üí Search for USER_DEBUG ‚Üí you‚Äôll see candidate records printed.

Step 4: SOQL with Condition Example: Get all candidates from Nagari:

List<Candidate__c> candList = [ SELECT Id, Email__c, Education__c, Place__c FROM Candidate__c WHERE Place__c = 'Nagari' ]; System.debug('Candidates from Nagari: ' + candList);

üîπ Step: Implementing SOSL SOSL is used when you want to search across multiple objects at once (Candidate, Skill, Job).

Step 1: Execute SOSL in Developer Console

Open Execute Anonymous (Ctrl+E).

Paste this code: List<List> searchResults = [ FIND 'Java*' IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Candidate__c (Id, Email__c, Education__c), Skill__c (Id, Skill_Name__c, Proficiency_Level__c), Job__c (Id, Job_Title__c, Job_Department__c) ]; System.debug('SOSL Results: ' + searchResults);

Click Execute with Open Log.

In the log, search USER_DEBUG ‚Üí You‚Äôll see results like:

‚Ä¢ Candidates who have ‚ÄúJava‚Äù in their Education/Email. ‚Ä¢ Skills with ‚ÄúJava‚Äù in Skill_Name__c. ‚Ä¢ Jobs with ‚ÄúJava‚Äù in Job_Title__c or Department.

Step: Apply to our Project Example Use Cases:

Find Jobs Matching Candidate Skills Id candId = 'PUT_CANDIDATE_ID_HERE'; List<Skill__c> skills = [ SELECT Skill_Name__c FROM Skill__c WHERE Candidate__c = :candId ]; Set skillNames = new Set(); for (Skill__c s : skills) { skillNames.add(s.Skill_Name__c); } List<Job__c> matchingJobs = [ SELECT Id, Job_Title__c, Job_Department__c, salary_range__c FROM Job__c WHERE Job_Department__c IN :skillNames ]; System.debug('Matching Jobs: ' + matchingJobs);

Search Candidates, Skills, Jobs at Once (Use the SOSL example above).

Collections (List, Set, Map) o List ‚Üí Store multiple training enrollments. o Set ‚Üí Prevent duplicate skill assignments. o Map ‚Üí Map candidate IDs to their completed courses.
Apex Collections Collections are variables that store multiple values in a single variable. Apex supports three types: Type Description Example Use in Your Project List Ordered collection (like array) Store all Skills of a Candidate Set Unordered collection with unique values Keep unique Skill Names Map Key-value pairs Map Candidate Id ‚Üí Candidate record

1Ô∏è Lists Example: List of Skills for a Candidate // Fetch all skills for a candidate Id candId = 'PUT_CANDIDATE_ID_HERE'; List<Skill__c> skillList = [ SELECT Skill_Name__c, Proficiency_Level__c FROM Skill__c WHERE Candidate__c = :candId ]; // Iterate through the list for(Skill__c s : skillList){ System.debug('Skill Name: ' + s.Skill_Name__c + ', Level: ' + s.Proficiency_Level__c); }

Use Case: Display all skills of a candidate

2Ô∏è Sets Example: Unique Skill Names List<Skill__c> skills = [ SELECT Skill_Name__c FROM Skill__c WHERE Candidate__c = :candId ]; Set uniqueSkills = new Set(); for(Skill__c s : skills){ uniqueSkills.add(s.Skill_Name__c); } System.debug('Unique Skills: ' + uniqueSkills);

Use Case: Avoid duplicate skills when assigning new ones.

3Ô∏è Maps Example: Candidate Id ‚Üí Candidate Record // Fetch all candidates in a department List<Candidate__c> candList = [ SELECT Id, Email__c, Education__c FROM Candidate__c WHERE Education__c = 'B Tech' ]; // Convert to map for easy lookup Map<Id, Candidate__c> candidateMap = new Map<Id, Candidate__c>(candList); // Access a candidate quickly by Id Id myCandId = 'PUT_CANDIDATE_ID_HERE'; Candidate__c myCandidate = candidateMap.get(myCandId); System.debug('Candidate Email: ' + myCandidate.Email__c);

Use Case: When matching candidates to jobs based on skill sets, you can quickly look up a candidate without looping through a list.

4Ô∏è Combine Collections Example: Filter Jobs Based on Candidate Skills Id candId = 'PUT_CANDIDATE_ID_HERE'; // Step 1: Get candidate skills List<Skill__c> skills = [ SELECT Skill_Name__c FROM Skill__c WHERE Candidate__c = :candId ]; Set skillSet = new Set(); for(Skill__c s : skills){ skillSet.add(s.Skill_Name__c); } // Step 2: Fetch Jobs where department matches any skill List<Job__c> jobs = [ SELECT Id, Job_Title__c, Job_Department__c FROM Job__c WHERE Job_Department__c IN :skillSet ]; System.debug('Matching Jobs: ' + jobs);

Explanation: ‚Ä¢ Set prevents duplicate skill names. ‚Ä¢ List stores Jobs that match those skills.

Filters job based on skills, as there is no job here shows empty set

5Ô∏è Test Collections in Developer Console

Open Developer Console ‚Üí Execute Anonymous
Paste the above example for filtering jobs by candidate skills
Click Execute
Check Logs ‚Üí USER_DEBUG for outputs
This completes Collections (List, Set, Map) and how to use them practically in your Skill & Employment Portal.

Control Statements o IF-ELSE ‚Üí Validate candidate eligibility. o FOR loops ‚Üí Process multiple enrollments/applications in bulk. Control statements help you decide the flow of code‚Äîlike loops, conditionals, and branching. They are essential when processing Candidates, Skills, Trainings, or Jobs.
1Ô∏è IF‚ÄìELSE Statements ‚úÖ Example: Assign Skill Based on Education

Use Case: Auto-assign skills based on candidate education.

2Ô∏è FOR Loops Example: Assign Default Skill to Multiple Candidates List<Candidate__c> candidates = [SELECT Id FROM Candidate__c WHERE Place__c = 'Nagari']; List<Skill__c> skillsToInsert = new List<Skill__c>(); for(Candidate__c c : candidates) { skillsToInsert.add(new Skill__c( Candidate__c = c.Id, Skill_Name__c = 'Profile Created' )); } insert skillsToInsert; System.debug('Default skills assigned to ' + skillsToInsert.size() + ' candidates');

3Ô∏è WHILE Loops Example: Process Jobs Until Threshold List<Job__c> jobs = [SELECT Id, Job_Title__c FROM Job__c LIMIT 5]; Integer i = 0; while(i < jobs.size()) { System.debug('Processing Job: ' + jobs[i].Job_Title__c); i++; }

4Ô∏è SWITCH Statements (Apex 50+)

Example: Assign Skill Category Based on Department String dept = 'IT'; String category; switch on dept { when 'IT' { category = 'Technical'; } when 'HR' { category = 'Management'; } when 'Sales' { category = 'Business'; } when else { category = 'General'; } } System.debug('Skill Category: ' + category);

5 Practical usecases of our Project ‚Ä¢ Use IF‚ÄìELSE to validate inputs (e.g., check candidate email, contact number). ‚Ä¢ Use FOR loops to bulk process multiple candidates, jobs, or skills. ‚Ä¢ Use SWITCH to categorize jobs, skills, or training programs. ‚Ä¢ Avoid SOQL inside loops‚Äîalways query first, then loop through results.

Test in Developer Console List<Candidate__c> candidates = [SELECT Id, Education__c FROM Candidate__c LIMIT 3]; for(Candidate__c c : candidates) { if(c.Education__c == 'B Tech') { System.debug('Assign Programming Skill to: ' + c.Id); } else { System.debug('Assign General Skill to: ' + c.Id); } } ‚Ä¢ Open Execute Anonymous ‚Üí Run ‚Üí Check Logs ‚Üí USER_DEBUG ‚Ä¢ You will see which candidate gets which skill.

Batch Apex
Batch Apex allows you to process thousands of records asynchronously in batches of 200 by default. A batch class implements the Database.Batchable interface and has 3 main methods: Method Purpose start Collects the records to process (returns a QueryLocator or iterable) execute Processes each batch of records finish Executes code after all batches are processed

1 Use Case for our Project Scenario: Assign a default skill to all candidates who completed a training program. ‚Ä¢ Object: Candidate__c ‚Ä¢ Related Object: Training__c ‚Ä¢ Create Skill__c records for each candidate after training completion.

2Ô∏è Example Batch Apex Class global class AssignSkillBatch implements Database.Batchable { // Step 1: start() - Fetch all completed trainings global Database.QueryLocator start(Database.BatchableContext BC) { return Database.getQueryLocator([ SELECT Id, Candidate__c, Training_Name__c FROM Training__c WHERE Training_Status__c = 'Completed' ]); } // Step 2: execute() - Process each batch of records global void execute(Database.BatchableContext BC, List<Training__c> scope) { List<Skill__c> skillsToInsert = new List<Skill__c>(); for(Training__c tr : scope) { skillsToInsert.add(new Skill__c( Candidate__c = tr.Candidate__c, Skill_Name__c = tr.Training_Name__c )); } if(!skillsToInsert.isEmpty()) { insert skillsToInsert; } } // Step 3: finish() - Optional: Send notification or log global void finish(Database.BatchableContext BC) { System.debug('Batch Apex completed: Skills assigned successfully!'); } }

3Ô∏è How to Run Batch Apex Option 1: Execute Anonymous // Run batch with batch size of 200 AssignSkillBatch batch = new AssignSkillBatch(); Database.executeBatch(batch, 200);

Option 2: Schedule Batch (optional) String cronExp = '0 0 23 * * ?'; // Run daily at 11 PM System.schedule('Daily Skill Assignment', cronExp, new AssignSkillBatch());

4Ô∏è How It Works

start() ‚Üí Fetch all Training__c records with status Completed
execute() ‚Üí For each batch of 200 trainings, create corresponding Skill__c records
finish() ‚Üí Logs or sends notification when batch is complete
o Use case: Bulk update ‚ÄúCertified‚Äù status for thousands of candidates after training completion. o Supports Skill Development at scale.

Queueable Apex o Use case: Match skills to jobs when a new job posting is created. o Asynchronous processing improves performance.
Queueable Apex is like a lightweight version of Batch Apex: ‚Ä¢ Can be run asynchronously ‚Ä¢ Can be chained (one job starts another) ‚Ä¢ Supports complex objects, SObjects, and collections

1Ô∏è Use Case in Your Project Scenario: Automatically assign a skill to a candidate right after a training is marked complete, without waiting for a batch job. ‚Ä¢ Object: Candidate__c ‚Ä¢ Related Object: Training__c ‚Ä¢ Create Skill__c record asynchronously after training completion.

2Ô∏è Queueable Apex Class Example public class AssignSkillQueueable implements Queueable { private Id trainingId; // Constructor public AssignSkillQueueable(Id trId) { this.trainingId = trId; } public void execute(QueueableContext context) { // Fetch the Training record Training__c tr = [ SELECT Id, Candidate__c, Training_Name__c FROM Training__c WHERE Id = :trainingId LIMIT 1 ]; // Create the Skill record Skill__c skill = new Skill__c( Candidate__c = tr.Candidate__c, Skill_Name__c = tr.Training_Name__c ); insert skill; System.debug('Skill assigned asynchronously: ' + skill.Skill_Name__c); } }

3Ô∏è How to Run Queueable Apex Option 1: Execute Anonymous (Immediate) Id completedTrainingId = 'PUT_TRAINING_RECORD_ID_HERE'; System.enqueueJob(new AssignSkillQueueable(completedTrainingId));

Option 2: Chain Queueable Jobs // Inside execute(), you can enqueue another job if needed System.enqueueJob(new AnotherQueueableJob(nextId));

4Ô∏è Practical Implementation in our Project

Create the class AssignSkillQueueable in Apex Classes
After a training is marked Completed, run this queueable: ‚Ä¢ Either manually via Developer Console ‚Ä¢ Or trigger it automatically via after update trigger on Training__c Example Trigger: trigger TrainingTrigger on Training__c (after update) { for(Training__c tr : Trigger.new) { Training__c oldTr = Trigger.oldMap.get(tr.Id); // Only enqueue when status changes to Completed if(tr.Training_Status__c == 'Completed' && oldTr.Training_Status__c != 'Completed') { System.enqueueJob(new AssignSkillQueueable(tr.Id)); } } }
Benefits ‚Ä¢ Lightweight compared to batch ‚Ä¢ Runs asynchronously without blocking UI ‚Ä¢ Can process large SObjects safely ‚Ä¢ Can be chained for multiple sequential operations

Scheduled Apex
Scheduled Apex allows you to schedule any Apex class that implements the Schedulable interface. Key Points: ‚Ä¢ Must implement the Schedulable interface ‚Ä¢ Has execute(SchedulableContext sc) method ‚Ä¢ Can schedule daily, weekly, or monthly using cron expressions

1Ô∏è Use Case in our Project Scenario: Automatically assign skills to all candidates who completed training every day at 11 PM. ‚Ä¢ Object: Training__c ‚Ä¢ Related Object: Candidate__c ‚Ä¢ Action: Run the AssignSkillBatch class automatically

2Ô∏è Example Scheduled Apex Class global class ScheduleAssignSkill implements Schedulable { global void execute(SchedulableContext sc) { // Run the batch to assign skills AssignSkillBatch batch = new AssignSkillBatch(); Database.executeBatch(batch, 200); System.debug('Scheduled Batch Apex executed successfully!'); } }

3Ô∏è To Schedule the Apex Job Option 1: Developer Console (Execute Anonymous) // Cron Expression: "0 0 23 * * ?" ‚Üí Runs daily at 11 PM String cronExp = '0 0 23 * * ?'; System.schedule('Daily Skill Assignment', cronExp, new ScheduleAssignSkill()); Option 2: Salesforce UI

Go to Setup ‚Üí Apex Classes ‚Üí Schedule Apex ‚Üí New
Enter Job Name ‚Üí e.g., Daily Skill Assignment
Select Apex Class ‚Üí ScheduleAssignSkill
Define Frequency ‚Üí daily, weekly, or monthly
Set Start & End Dates and Preferred Time
Click Save
4Ô∏è How It Works

Salesforce runs the ScheduleAssignSkill.execute() method at the scheduled time
Inside it, the AssignSkillBatch is executed to process completed trainings
Skills are assigned automatically without any manual intervention
‚úÖ Practical use for Your Project o Use case: o Send weekly reminders to candidates for pending training. o Notify employers about candidate shortlists.

Future Methods Future methods allows to: ‚Ä¢ Run Apex asynchronously ‚Ä¢ Avoid blocking the user interface ‚Ä¢ Execute tasks later in a separate thread Key Points: ‚Ä¢ Annotated with @future ‚Ä¢ Must be static ‚Ä¢ Can only accept primitive data types or collections (no sObjects or complex objects) ‚Ä¢ Cannot return a value
1Ô∏è Use Case in Your Project Scenario: Send a notification email to the candidate after a skill is assigned. ‚Ä¢ Object: Candidate__c ‚Ä¢ Trigger: After skill assignment ‚Ä¢ Action: Email candidate asynchronously using a future method

2Ô∏è Example Future Method public class CandidateNotification { @future public static void sendSkillNotification(Id candidateId, String skillName) { Candidate__c cand = [SELECT Id, Email__c, Student_Name__c FROM Candidate__c WHERE Id = :candidateId LIMIT 1]; // Example: Just debug for now System.debug('Email sent to ' + cand.Email__c + ' about new skill: ' + skillName); // In real scenario, you can use Messaging.sendEmail() here } }

3Ô∏è How to Call the Future Method // After skill assignment Id candidateId = 'PUT_CANDIDATE_ID_HERE'; String newSkill = 'Java Programming'; CandidateNotification.sendSkillNotification(candidateId, newSkill); ‚Ä¢ This call returns immediately; the job runs asynchronously in the background

4Ô∏è Trigger Example for Your Project You can call the future method from a trigger when a new Skill__c is inserted: trigger SkillTrigger on Skill__c (after insert) { for(Skill__c s : Trigger.new) { CandidateNotification.sendSkillNotification(s.Candidate__c, s.Skill_Name__c); } } ‚Ä¢ Every time a new skill is added, the candidate gets a notification asynchronously

Benefits ‚Ä¢ Runs asynchronously, so it doesn‚Äôt slow down the user interface ‚Ä¢ Can handle multiple operations in the background ‚Ä¢ Simple to implement for notifications, logging, or external API calls

o Use case: External API callouts to integrate with training providers (Coursera/edX).

Exception Handling Purpose: ‚Ä¢ Catch and handle runtime errors gracefully ‚Ä¢ Prevent your Apex code from failing unexpectedly ‚Ä¢ Log errors for debugging and auditing Key Concepts: Term Description try Block of code where errors might occur catch Block to handle the exception finally Optional block that always executes, used for cleanup throw Used to raise a custom exception
1Ô∏è Use Case in our Project Scenario: ‚Ä¢ While assigning skills or creating jobs, some records might fail due to missing required fields or duplicate values. ‚Ä¢ Handle these errors gracefully and optionally log them in a custom object like Error_Log__c.

2Ô∏è Example: Standard Exception Handling public class SkillManagerSafe { public static void assignSkillSafe(Id candidateId, String skillName) { try { // Attempt to assign skill Skill__c newSkill = new Skill__c( Candidate__c = candidateId, Skill_Name__c = skillName ); insert newSkill; System.debug('Skill assigned: ' + skillName); } catch(DmlException e) { System.debug('Error inserting Skill: ' + e.getMessage()); // Optional: log error to a custom object Error_Log__c log = new Error_Log__c( Name = 'Skill Assignment Error', Description__c = e.getMessage() ); insert log; } finally { System.debug('Execution completed

for assignSkillSafe method'); } } }

3Ô∏è Example: Throwing Custom Exceptions public class JobApplicationHandler { public class JobApplicationException extends Exception {} public static void applyCandidate(Id candidateId, Id jobId) { // Check if application already exists List<Job_Application__c> existingApps = [ SELECT Id FROM Job_Application__c WHERE Candidate__c = :candidateId AND Job__c = :jobId ]; if(!existingApps.isEmpty()) { // Throw custom exception throw new JobApplicationException('Candidate has already applied for this job.'); } // Insert application if no error Job_Application__c newApp = new Job_Application__c( Candidate__c = candidateId, Job__c = jobId, Application_Status__c = 'Applied' ); insert newApp; } }

‚Ä¢ Use Case: Prevent duplicates and notify users/programmatically handle errors

o Example: Candidate profile missing mandatory details. o try-catch-finally ensures errors don‚Äôt break bulk operations.

Test Classes o Test skill assignment, enrollment automation, and job validation. o Ensures 75%+ code coverage for deployment. Example: @isTest private class SkillManagerTest { @isTest static void testAssignSkill(){ Candidate__c cand = new Candidate__c(Name='Test User', Email__c='test@test.com'); insert cand; SkillManager.assignSkill(cand.Id, 'Apex Development'); List<Skill__c> skills = [SELECT Name FROM Skill__c WHERE Candidate__c = :cand.Id]; System.assertEquals('Apex Development', skills[0].Name); } }
Key Points: ‚Ä¢ Must be annotated with @isTest ‚Ä¢ Should cover at least 75% of Apex code for production deployment ‚Ä¢ Can create test data in the class (don‚Äôt rely on existing org data) ‚Ä¢ Can test both positive and negative scenarios

1Ô∏è Test Class for SkillManagerSafe @isTest public class SkillManagerSafeTest { @isTest static void testAssignSkillSafeSuccess() { // 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create test Candidate Candidate__c testCandidate = new Candidate__c( Email__c = 'testuser@example.com', ContactNumber__c = '9001234567', Student_Name__c = 'a01gL000000XXXX' // Replace with actual Student Id or create test Student ); insert testCandidate; // 2Ô∏è‚É£ Call the safe method Test.startTest(); SkillManagerSafe.assignSkillSafe(testCandidate.Id, 'Java Programming'); Test.stopTest(); // 3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Skill record was created List<Skill__c> skills = [SELECT Id, Skill_Name__c, Candidate__c FROM Skill__c WHERE Candidate__c = :testCandidate.Id]; System.assertEquals(1, skills.size(), 'One skill record should be created'); System.assertEquals('Java Programming', skills[0].Skill_Name__c, 'Skill name should match'); } @isTest static void testAssignSkillSafeException() { // 1Ô∏è‚É£ Call method with invalid Candidate Id to force exception Test.startTest(); try { SkillManagerSafe.assignSkillSafe('invalidId', 'Python Programming'); } catch (Exception e) { System.debug('Expected exception caught: ' + e.getMessage()); } Test.stopTest(); // 2Ô∏è‚É£ Verify error was logged List<Error_Log__c> logs = [SELECT Id, Name, Description__c FROM Error_Log__c WHERE Name = 'Skill Assignment Error']; System.assert(logs.size() > 0, 'Error log should be created'); } }

2Ô∏è Steps to Run the Test

Asynchronous Processing o Skill Development Side: Bulk process course enrollments. o Employment Side: Bulk process job applications during campus drives. Salesforce provides multiple ways to execute operations in the background without blocking the user interface. In your project, you used: Method Use Case in Your Project Key Points Batch Apex Assign skills to all candidates who completed training Handles large datasets (50M+ records) Queueable Apex Assign skills as soon as a training is completed Can chain jobs, supports complex objects Scheduled Apex Run skill assignments daily or send notifications Schedule batch or queueable jobs at a specific time Future Methods Send emails/notifications asynchronously Simple, fire-and-forget, cannot return values
Practical Flow for our Project

Candidate completes training ‚Üí trigger fires
Queueable Apex assigns skill asynchronously
Future Method sends notification email to candidate
Batch Apex can process all trainings in bulk nightly
Scheduled Apex runs Batch Apex automatically every day Visual Flow: Training__c Update ‚Üí Trigger ‚Üí Queueable Apex (Assign Skill) ‚Üí Future Method (Notify Candidate) ‚Üò Scheduled Apex ‚Üí Batch Apex (Nightly Skill Assignment)
2Ô∏è Best Practices for Asynchronous Processing ‚Ä¢ Using Queueable instead of Future for complex objects ‚Ä¢ Chain Queueables for sequential operations ‚Ä¢ Batch Apex for bulk operations over thousands/millions of records ‚Ä¢ Always include Test Classes for async methods: ‚Ä¢ Use Test.startTest() and Test.stopTest() to execute async jobs in tests ‚Ä¢ Handle exceptions inside async jobs (try-catch) to avoid silent failures ‚Ä¢ Use limits wisely: ‚Ä¢ Queueable: 50 jobs in queue at a time ‚Ä¢ Batch: can process 50 million records ‚Ä¢ Future: 50 calls per transaction

3Ô∏è Example Combined Scenario trigger TrainingTrigger on Training__c (after update) { for(Training__c tr : Trigger.new) { Training__c oldTr = Trigger.oldMap.get(tr.Id); if(tr.Training_Status__c == 'Completed' && oldTr.Training_Status__c != 'Completed') { // Assign skill asynchronously System.enqueueJob(new AssignSkillQueueable(tr.Id)); } } } // Scheduled Apex runs nightly global class ScheduleAssignSkill implements Schedulable { global void execute(SchedulableContext sc) { Database.executeBatch(new AssignSkillBatch(), 200); } } // Future method for notifications public class CandidateNotification { @future public static void sendSkillNotification(Id candidateId, String skillName) { // Send email or debug System.debug('Notification sent to Candidate: ' + candidateId + ' for skill: ' + skillName); } }

Summary ‚Ä¢ Queueable ‚Üí real-time async processing ‚Ä¢ Batch Apex ‚Üí bulk processing (large datasets) ‚Ä¢ Scheduled Apex ‚Üí time-based automation ‚Ä¢ Future Methods ‚Üí lightweight async (notifications/logs) ‚Ä¢ Exception Handling ‚Üí ensures safe execution ‚Ä¢ Test Classes ‚Üí verify all scenarios

This completes Phase 5: Apex Programming for your Skill Development & Employment Portal.

üîπ Phase 5 Deliverables o Apex Classes for skill management, enrollment, and job applications. o Triggers with handler classes. o Batch, Queueable, Scheduled Apex jobs. o Exception handling with logs. o Unit test classes with high code coverage.

üîπ How Phase 5 Connects Skill Development & Employment ‚úÖ Candidates can enroll in training programs ‚Üí Skills automatically updated. ‚úÖ Employers can search/filter candidates based on acquired skills. ‚úÖ Job applications are auto-validated against required skills. ‚úÖ Bulk operations (batch jobs) ensure scalability for large user bases. This phase marks the fusion of Skill Development and Employment Management, making the portal more intelligent, automated, and scalable.

Phase 6: User Interface Development

Introduction ÔÅ∂ In this phase, we focus on designing and building the User Interface (UI) for the Skill Development and Employment Portal. The goal is to provide an interactive, responsive, and user-friendly interface where candidates, employers, and administrators can seamlessly interact with the system.

ÔÅ∂ This is achieved using Salesforce Lightning Experience features such as Lightning App Builder, Record Pages, Tabs, Utility Bar, and advanced customization with Lightning Web Components (LWC) integrated with Apex.

Lightning App Builder The Lightning App Builder is used to create and customize application pages with drag-and-drop components. ‚Ä¢ Use Case in our Portal: ‚Ä¢ Create a Candidate Dashboard Page displaying job recommendations, applied jobs, and skill progress. ‚Ä¢ Create an Employer Dashboard Page showing posted jobs, candidate applications, and recruitment analytics. ‚Ä¢ Implementation: ‚Ä¢ Custom pages are built with standard and custom components. ‚Ä¢ Example: A "Skill Growth Tracker" component placed in the candidate‚Äôs home page to show certifications and progress.
Goal Creating app pages/dashboards for the three main personas (Candidate, Employer, Admin) using Lightning App Builder. Place a mix of standard components and placeholders for the LWCs you‚Äôll build later (CandidateProfileCard, JobRecommendationList, ApplicationTracker). Activate each page for the correct app/profile so users see the right UI.

Pre-reqs (from my earlier phases) ‚Ä¢ Objects and fields exist from Phase 3: Candidate__c, Job__c, Application__c, Skill__c, Certification__c (if your API names differ, use those names). ‚Ä¢ Any Apex classes you wrote earlier (e.g., SkillManagerSafe, JobService) are deployed ‚Äî those will be wired to LWCs later. ‚Ä¢ You have admin access to the org to create & activate pages.

What we‚Äôll do (step-by-step)

Open Lightning App Builder ‚Ä¢ In Salesforce: click the Gear (Setup) icon ‚Üí Setup. ‚Ä¢ In Quick Find box type Lightning App Builder ‚Üí open it.

Create a new App Page for Candidate Dashboard ‚Ä¢ Click New ‚Üí choose App Page ‚Üí Next. ‚Ä¢ Choose a layout (recommend: Header + Three Columns or One Region with Sidebar). ‚Ä¢ Rationale: Candidate dashboard benefits from a header (name, quick actions) + 2‚Äì3 columns (profile, recommendations, activity). ‚Ä¢ Name it: Candidate Dashboard - SkillDevPortal. ‚Ä¢ Click Finish to open the builder canvas.

Add components onto the canvas ‚Ä¢ Left panel: drag standard components first: ‚Ä¢ Rich Text (header area) ‚Äî add a welcome message and use tokens like Hello, {!$User.FirstName} (or leave placeholder).

‚Ä¢ Report Chart or List View ‚Äî show ‚ÄúRecommended Jobs‚Äù or ‚ÄúOpen Jobs‚Äù. ‚Ä¢ Related Lists - Single (if candidate record context will be used later).

‚Ä¢ Add Custom Component placeholders: drag a Custom component area and label it CandidateProfileCard (LWC) and JobRecommendationList (LWC) ‚Äî these will be replaced by your actual LWCs later.

Configure component properties ‚Ä¢ For each component, set properties to match your data model: ‚Ä¢ Example: For a List View component, set Object = Job__c, Filter = Active = true. ‚Ä¢ For custom LWC placeholders, add a Component Name and a short Label in properties. ‚Ä¢ If a component accepts a recordId or userId, set the property to use $User.Id (or plan to pass it from record pages).

Save and Activate ‚Ä¢ Click Save. ‚Ä¢ Click Activation ‚Üí Choose how this page is used:

‚Ä¢ App Default: select the Lightning App (e.g., SkillDevPortal App) and set App Default if you want it as the app‚Äôs default page. ‚Ä¢ App and Profile: assign the Candidate Dashboard only to the Candidate profile (or a permission set) so only candidates see it. ‚Ä¢ You can also set it as Org Default or assign to specific record pages ‚Äî for now use App & Profile to scope to Candidate users. ‚Ä¢ Click Activate ‚Üí confirm assignments ‚Üí Done. ‚Ä¢ Screenshot to take: Activation dialog showing App/Profile assignment. 6. Verify in Lightning Experience ‚Ä¢ Open App Launcher, switch to the SkillDevPortal app (or the app you assigned), and open the Candidate Dashboard. ‚Ä¢ Confirm components render (placeholders will show until LWCs built).

Record Pages o Record pages define the layout of data records. o Now that the App Page (3-column console) is set, the next step is to configure Record Pages for your key objects.
Go to Record Pages
In Salesforce Setup ‚Üí search App Builder.
Select Lightning App Builder.
At the top, switch from App Page to Record Page.
Click New Record Page.
Create a Record Page for Job__c ‚Ä¢ Name: Job Record Page ‚Ä¢ Object: Job__c ‚Ä¢ Page Type: Record Page
Layout to build: ‚Ä¢ Left Panel: Highlights Panel (shows job title, status, key fields)

‚Ä¢ Middle Panel: Record Details (standard job fields)

‚Ä¢ Tabs: Add tabs for ‚Ä¢ Candidates (Related List) ‚Ä¢ Skills Required (custom related list if you added) ‚Ä¢ Right Panel: Activity (Log a Call, Email, Notes, etc.)

Create a Record Page for Candidate__c ‚Ä¢ Name: Candidate Record Page ‚Ä¢ Object: Candidate__c ‚Ä¢ Page Type: Record Page ‚Ä¢ Assign to: Recruitment App Layout to build: ‚Ä¢ Left Panel: Highlights Panel (Candidate name, email, phone) ‚Ä¢ Middle Panel: Record Detail (candidate info, experience, resume link) ‚Ä¢ Tabs: Add tabs for ‚Ä¢ Skills (related list) ‚Ä¢ Certifications (related list) ‚Ä¢ Applications (junction object Job‚ÄìCandidate) ‚Ä¢ Right Panel: Activity timeline
(Optional) Create a Record Page for Application__c If you made a junction object (Job Application): ‚Ä¢ Shows Job__c lookup, Candidate__c lookup, Status, Interview Date etc.
‚Ä¢ Use Case in Portal: ‚Ä¢ Candidate record page ‚Üí Displays personal details, skills, certifications, and job applications. ‚Ä¢ Job record page ‚Üí Shows job description, required skills, employer details, and candidate applications. ‚Ä¢ Implementation: ‚Ä¢ Customize record detail pages using related lists (e.g., Candidate ‚Üí Job Applications, Employer ‚Üí Posted Jobs). ‚Ä¢ Add quick actions like "Apply for Job" or "Schedule Interview."

Tabs o Tabs provide structured navigation within the portal. o Tabs are UI elements that let users navigate between different views or data objects within an app. There are three main types:
Standard Object Tabs ‚Äì for Salesforce standard objects like Accounts, Contacts, Leads.
Custom Object Tabs ‚Äì for your custom objects like Candidate__c, Job__c, Skill__c, Certification__c.
Visualforce / Lightning Page Tabs ‚Äì for custom pages, dashboards, or LWCs. In your portal, you will use: ‚Ä¢ Candidate Tabs: Dashboard, My Profile, Skills, Job Applications, Certifications. ‚Ä¢ Employer Tabs: Dashboard, Post Job, Manage Applications, Candidate Search. ‚Ä¢ Admin Tabs: Reports, Skill Database, Approvals, Analytics.
üîπ Step 2 ‚Äî Creating Custom Object Tabs

Go to Setup ‚Üí Tabs ‚Ä¢ Search: Tabs in Quick Find. ‚Ä¢ You‚Äôll see sections: Custom Object Tabs, Web Tabs, Visualforce Tabs.
Create Custom Tabs for Objects ‚Ä¢ Click New under Custom Object Tabs. ‚Ä¢ Object: Choose your custom object (e.g., Candidate__c). ‚Ä¢ Tab Style: Pick an icon/color. ‚Ä¢ Tab Name: Candidate. ‚Ä¢ Click Next ‚Üí Save. Repeat for: ‚Ä¢ Job__c ‚Üí Tab Name: Job ‚Ä¢ Skill__c ‚Üí Tab Name: Skill ‚Ä¢ Certification__c ‚Üí Tab Name: Certification ‚Ä¢ Application__c ‚Üí Tab Name: Applications
üîπ Step 3 ‚Äî Adding Tabs to Lightning App

Go to App Manager ‚Üí Find your app (e.g., SkillDevPortal) ‚Üí Edit.
Navigate to Navigation Items.
Add the Tabs you created:
‚Ä¢ Candidate, Job, Skill, Certification, Application. 4. Reorder tabs for each persona: ‚Ä¢ Candidate: Dashboard ‚Üí My Profile ‚Üí Skills ‚Üí Certifications ‚Üí Applications. ‚Ä¢ Employer: Dashboard ‚Üí Post Job ‚Üí Manage Applications ‚Üí Candidate Search ‚Üí Reports. 5. Click Save & Finish.

üîπ Step 4 ‚Äî Tabs on Record Pages or Dashboards (Lightning App Builder) Sometimes within a Record Page or Dashboard App Page, you want to organize components in tabs. Example: Candidate Record Page Tabs ‚Ä¢ Drag Tabs component from the Standard Components panel. ‚Ä¢ Inside Tabs:

Tab 1 ‚Üí Candidate Details ‚Ä¢ Drag Record Detail component here. ‚Ä¢ Shows personal info, email, phone, resume.

Tab 2 ‚Üí Skills ‚Ä¢ Drag Related List ‚Äì Single ‚Ä¢ Configure: Related List = Skill__c (Candidate Skills)

Tab 3 ‚Üí Certifications ‚Ä¢ Drag Related List ‚Äì Single ‚Ä¢ Configure: Related List = Certification__c

Tab 4 ‚Üí Applications ‚Ä¢ Drag Related List ‚Äì Single ‚Ä¢ Configure: Related List = Application__c

Example: Job Record Page Tabs ‚Ä¢ Tab 1 ‚Üí Job Details (Record Detail) ‚Ä¢ Tab 2 ‚Üí Candidate Applications (Related List) ‚Ä¢ Tab 3 ‚Üí Required Skills (Related List) ‚ö° Tip: You can rename the Tab Labels in the properties panel (e.g., ‚ÄúMy Skills‚Äù, ‚ÄúApplications History‚Äù) to make it more user-friendly.

üîπ Step 5 ‚Äî Tabs in LWCs If you‚Äôre building Lightning Web Components for dashboards: ‚Ä¢ Use lightning-tabset and lightning-tab in your LWC HTML. ‚Ä¢ Example: Candidate Dashboard LWC with Tabs: ‚Ä¢ Each tab loads a separate LWC component dynamically. ‚Ä¢ Can include @wire or imperative Apex calls in each component to fetch data. We well see them in our further steps

üîπ Step 6 ‚Äî Key Benefits for Your Portal

Organized UI ‚Äì Users don‚Äôt need to scroll endlessly.
Persona-specific Navigation ‚Äì Candidate, Employer, Admin tabs show relevant info only.
Dynamic Data Display ‚Äì Tabs can include Record Detail, Related Lists, and LWCs.
Easy Expansion ‚Äì Add more tabs later (e.g., ‚ÄúInterview Feedback‚Äù, ‚ÄúJob Alerts‚Äù).
‚Ä¢ Use Case in Portal: ‚Ä¢ Candidate Tabs: Dashboard, My Profile, Skills, Job Applications, Certifications. ‚Ä¢ Employer Tabs: Dashboard, Post Job, Manage Applications, Candidate Search. ‚Ä¢ Admin Tabs: Reports, Skill Database, Approvals, Analytics. ‚Ä¢ Implementation: ‚Ä¢ Created custom tabs for objects: Candidate, Job, Skill, Certification, and Application. ‚Ä¢ Tabs linked to record pages for seamless navigation.

Home Page Layouts o The Home Page is customized to act as the central hub for different users. o The Home Page is the first thing users see when they log in to the portal. Customizing it makes your portal personalized, intuitive, and actionable. You can create different home pages for Candidates, Employers, and Admins. Why Customize Home Pages ‚Ä¢ Provide a central hub for users. ‚Ä¢ Highlight key metrics, tasks, and reports. ‚Ä¢ Add quick actions to improve workflow efficiency. ‚Ä¢ Incorporate custom LWCs to show dynamic content (jobs, skill progress, application tracker).
Step-by-Step: Create a Home Page Layout 1Ô∏è‚É£ Open Lightning App Builder for Home Page ‚Ä¢ Click Gear Icon ‚Üí Setup. ‚Ä¢ Search Lightning App Builder. ‚Ä¢ Click New ‚Üí Home Page.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Choose a Layout Salesforce provides standard layouts: ‚Ä¢ Header + Three Columns ‚Üí Dashboard style, good for candidates. ‚Ä¢ Header + Two Columns ‚Üí Balanced layout for employers. ‚Ä¢ One Column ‚Üí Simple layout, good for Admin home page.

Lightning Web Components (LWC) LWCs provide modern, reusable UI components. Step 1. What is LWC? ‚Ä¢ LWC is Salesforce‚Äôs modern framework for building UI components. ‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs built on web standards (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). ‚Ä¢ Can be placed on Record Pages, Home Pages, App Pages, Utility Bar, etc.
Step 2. Prerequisites

Install VS Code with Salesforce Extensions.
Connect your Salesforce org with SFDX (Salesforce CLI).
Open your project folder in VS Code.
Step 3. Create a New LWC

In VS Code: ‚Ä¢ Right click lwc folder ‚Üí Create Lightning Web Component. ‚Ä¢ Give it a name, e.g., helloportal.
It creates 3 files: ‚Ä¢ helloportal.html ‚Üí UI template ‚Ä¢ helloportal.js ‚Üí JS logic ‚Ä¢ helloportal.js-meta.xml ‚Üí Visibility metadata
Step 4. Basic Example helloWorld.html

Hello, {name}!

helloWorld.js import { LightningElement, track } from 'lwc'; export default class HelloWorld extends LightningElement { @track name = 'World'; handleChange(event) { this.name = event.target.value; } } helloWorld.js-meta.xml
60.0 true lightning__RecordPage lightning__AppPage lightning__HomePage
Step 5. Deploy to Salesforce ‚Ä¢ Right-click component ‚Üí SFDX: Deploy Source to Org. ‚Ä¢ Go to Salesforce ‚Üí Edit Page ‚Üí Drag helloWorld LWC into the layout.

‚Ä¢ Save & Activate.

Step 6. Try It ‚Ä¢ Open the page ‚Üí You‚Äôll see a card: ‚Ä¢ Type a name ‚Üí It updates dynamically.

What We Achieved ‚Ä¢ Created a basic LWC. ‚Ä¢ Learned about HTML, JS, XML structure. ‚Ä¢ Exposed it to pages. ‚Ä¢ Saw how data binding works in LWC.

‚Ä¢ Use Case in Portal: ‚Ä¢ CandidateProfileCard: Displays candidate details and skills. ‚Ä¢ JobRecommendationList: Shows recommended jobs based on skills. ‚Ä¢ ApplicationTracker: Monitors the status of job applications. ‚Ä¢ Implementation: ‚Ä¢ Designed LWCs with HTML, JS, and Apex integration for dynamic data display.

Apex with LWC Apex is used when LWC needs server-side operations. ‚Ä¢ Use Case in Portal: ‚Ä¢ Fetching all jobs matching candidate skills. ‚Ä¢ Returning shortlisted candidates for an employer‚Äôs job posting. ‚Ä¢ Implementation Example: ‚Ä¢ getRecommendedJobs(candidateId) Apex method called from LWC. ‚Ä¢ Data retrieved and rendered dynamically in the UI. ‚Ä¢ 1Ô∏è Apex Class (Server-Side) Suppose you want to fetch job applications for a candidate: public with sharing class JobApplicationController { @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true) public static List<Job_Application__c> getCandidateApplications(Id candidateId) { return [SELECT Id, Job__r.Name, Status__c FROM Job_Application__c WHERE Candidate__c = :candidateId]; } @AuraEnabled public static Job_Application__c updateApplicationStatus(Id appId, String status) { Job_Application__c app = [SELECT Id, Status__c FROM Job_Application__c WHERE Id = :appId LIMIT 1]; app.Status__c = status; update app; return app; } }
Notes: ‚Ä¢ @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true) ‚Üí for fetching data, allows Lightning Data Service caching. ‚Ä¢ @AuraEnabled ‚Üí for DML operations (insert/update).

2Ô∏è LWC: Child Component (Job Card)

Notes: ‚Ä¢ @api job ‚Üí receives job record from parent. ‚Ä¢ CustomEvent ‚Üí lets parent know the status changed.

3Ô∏è LWC: Parent Component (Job List / Application Tracker)

Notes: ‚Ä¢ for:each with key={job.Id} is mandatory in LWC iterators. ‚Ä¢ handleStatusChange updates the UI when a child component dispatches a status change event.

4Ô∏è Key Concepts in This Apex + LWC Event Flow Concept Explanation Apex Method Provides server-side data (queries/updates Salesforce records) @AuraEnabled Exposes Apex to LWC @api Exposes public property to parent component CustomEvent Dispatch from child ‚Üí parent detail Carries payload (e.g., { jobId, status }) for:each / key Required for iterators in template .then() Handles promise from Apex call

This setup supports three LWCs for your project:

CandidateProfileCard ‚Üí show candidate info, can dispatch event when details updated
ApplicationTracker ‚Üí list of applications, updates when status changes
JobRecommendationList ‚Üí similar pattern, dispatch event when a job is selected
Events in LWC Events enable communication between components. Child-to-Parent Communication (Custom Events) Use Case: When a user clicks Approve / Reject in JobCard (child), the parent ApplicationTracker needs to know and update the UI. Implementation in Child (jobCard.js) import { LightningElement, api } from 'lwc'; import updateApplicationStatus from '@salesforce/apex/JobApplicationController.updateApplicationStatus'; export default class JobCard extends LightningElement { @api job; // Record passed from parent approve() { this.updateStatus('Approved'); } reject() { this.updateStatus('Rejected'); } updateStatus(status) { updateApplicationStatus({ appId: this.job.Id, status: status }) .then(result => { // Dispatch event to parent const event = new CustomEvent('statuschange', { detail: { jobId: result.Id, status: result.Application_Status__c } }); this.dispatchEvent(event); }) .catch(error => console.error('Error updating status', error)); } } Key Points: ‚Ä¢ @api job ‚Üí receives data from parent. ‚Ä¢ CustomEvent ‚Üí sends payload { jobId, status } to parent. ‚Ä¢ dispatchEvent ‚Üí triggers the event.
2Ô∏è Parent Receives Event Parent HTML (applicationTracker.html) Parent JS (applicationTracker.js) handleStatusChange(event) { const { jobId, status } = event.detail; // Update the UI locally this.jobs = this.jobs.map(job => { if (job.Id === jobId) { return { ...job, Application_Status__c: status }; } return job; }); }

Key Points: ‚Ä¢ onstatuschange ‚Üí listens for event from child. ‚Ä¢ event.detail ‚Üí contains payload sent by child. ‚Ä¢ Update local @track jobs array ‚Üí ensures UI refresh.

3Ô∏è Optional: Parent-to-Child Communication ‚Ä¢ Use @api properties in child (jobCard) to pass updated data from parent if needed. ‚Ä¢ Example: @api job in child automatically receives updates when parent modifies the array.

4Ô∏è Testing Events

Deploy both parent and child LWCs.
Add parent component to Lightning page.
Click Approve/Reject in child ‚Üí check if: ‚Ä¢ Parent UI updates immediately. ‚Ä¢ Record is updated in Salesforce via Apex.
‚Ä¢ Use Case in Portal: ‚Ä¢ Candidate updates profile ‚Üí ProfileUpdated event ‚Üí Refresh Candidate Dashboard. ‚Ä¢ Employer posts new job ‚Üí NewJobPosted event ‚Üí Updates Employer Dashboard and sends notification. ‚Ä¢ Implementation: ‚Ä¢ Custom Events used for LWC-to-LWC communication. ‚Ä¢ Pub/Sub Events for communication between unrelated components.

Wire Adapters ‚Ä¢ Wire adapters are reactive mechanisms in Lightning Web Components to fetch Salesforce data without manually calling Apex every time. ‚Ä¢ They are imported from lwc or lightning/ui*Api modules. ‚Ä¢ When the data changes in Salesforce, the UI automatically updates. Key points: ‚Ä¢ Wire is reactive. If a property used in the wire changes, the wire runs again. ‚Ä¢ Used for calling Apex methods or standard Salesforce objects.
1 Wire with Apex Method Apex Class public with sharing class JobApplicationController { @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true) public static List<Application__c> getCandidateApplications(Id candidateId) { return [SELECT Id, Job__c, Application_Status__c FROM Application__c WHERE Candidate__c = :candidateId]; } } LWC JS import { LightningElement, wire, track } from 'lwc'; import getCandidateApplications from '@salesforce/apex/JobApplicationController.getCandidateApplications'; export default class ApplicationTracker extends LightningElement { @track jobs; candidateId = 'YOUR_CANDIDATE_ID_HERE'; @wire(getCandidateApplications, { candidateId: '$candidateId' }) wiredApplications({ error, data }) { if (data) { this.jobs = data; } else if (error) { console.error(error); } } } Notes: ‚Ä¢ Use $candidateId to make it reactive. If candidateId changes, wire re-runs. ‚Ä¢ @wire can be used with a function (for processing) or with a property (direct assignment).

2 Wire with Salesforce UI API (No Apex Needed) Lightning provides built-in wire adapters: a. Get Record import { LightningElement, wire } from 'lwc'; import { getRecord } from 'lightning/uiRecordApi'; import NAME_FIELD from '@salesforce/schema/Candidate__c.Candidate_Name__c'; import EMAIL_FIELD from '@salesforce/schema/Candidate__c.Email__c'; export default class CandidateCard extends LightningElement { recordId = 'YOUR_CANDIDATE_ID_HERE'; @wire(getRecord, { recordId: '$recordId', fields: [NAME_FIELD, EMAIL_FIELD] }) candidate; } ‚Ä¢ candidate.data ‚Üí contains record fields ‚Ä¢ candidate.error ‚Üí error details b. Get Records List import { LightningElement, wire, track } from 'lwc'; import { getListUi } from 'lightning/uiListApi'; import APPLICATION_OBJECT from '@salesforce/schema/Application__c'; export default class ApplicationList extends LightningElement { @track applications; @wire(getListUi, { objectApiName: APPLICATION_OBJECT, listViewApiName: 'All_Applications' }) wiredList({ error, data }) { if (data) { this.applications = data.records.records; } else if (error) { console.error(error); } } } ‚Ä¢ This avoids Apex if you just need standard queries.

3 Handling Reactive Changes ‚Ä¢ If a parameter changes, the wire runs again automatically. @track candidateId; @wire(getCandidateApplications, { candidateId: '$candidateId' }) wiredApplications({ error, data }) { ... } ‚Ä¢ Change candidateId dynamically, and jobs list updates without a refresh.

4 Key Tips for Wire Adapters

Use @track for reactive properties if you modify them.
Function vs Property: ‚Ä¢ Property: @wire(getCandidateApplications, { candidateId: '$candidateId' }) jobs; ‚Ä¢ Function: @wire(getCandidateApplications, { candidateId: '$candidateId' }) wiredJobs({error, data}) { ... }
Wire is read-only. To modify records, use Apex imperative calls or lightning/uiRecordApi updateRecord. We Already implemented this in our previous steps
‚Ä¢ Use Case in Portal: ‚Ä¢ Displaying real-time list of available jobs from Job__c object. ‚Ä¢ Showing candidate certifications directly from Certification__c object. ‚Ä¢ Implementation: ‚Ä¢ @wire(getRecord, { recordId: ‚Äò$recordId‚Äô, fields: [...] }) ‚Ä¢ Used in components like JobDetail and CandidateProfileCard.

Imperative Apex Calls When more control is required, imperative Apex calls are used.
Imperative Apex is calling an Apex method manually from JavaScript, rather than automatically via the @wire service. ‚Ä¢ @wire ‚Üí reactive, runs automatically when component loads or parameters change. ‚Ä¢ Imperative Apex ‚Üí explicit, you control when the call happens, e.g., on button click, user interaction, or after some calculation.

2Ô∏è When to Use ‚Ä¢ You want to call Apex only when user clicks a button (not automatically). ‚Ä¢ You need to pass dynamic parameters at runtime. ‚Ä¢ You want to handle promise results (success or error) in JS. Example scenarios: ‚Ä¢ Approving or rejecting a job application on button click. ‚Ä¢ Fetching filtered data based on user input. ‚Ä¢ Performing complex operations and updating the UI after completion.

3Ô∏è How It Works in LWC

Apex Class: public with sharing class JobApplicationController { @AuraEnabled public static Application__c updateApplicationStatus(Id appId, String status) { Application__c app = [SELECT Id, Application_Status__c FROM Application__c WHERE Id = :appId LIMIT 1]; app.Application_Status__c = status; update app; return app; } } ‚Ä¢ @AuraEnabled exposes this method to LWC. ‚Ä¢ Non-cacheable, because it updates data.
LWC JS (Imperative Call): import updateApplicationStatus from '@salesforce/apex/JobApplicationController.updateApplicationStatus'; updateStatus() { updateApplicationStatus({ appId: this.job.Id, status: 'Approved' }) .then(result => { console.log('Status updated:', result.Application_Status__c); }) .catch(error => { console.error('Error:', error); }); } ‚Ä¢ Call directly on button click or any event. ‚Ä¢ Returns a Promise, allowing .then() for success and .catch() for errors.
4Ô∏è Difference from @wire Feature @wire Imperative Call Timing Automatic Manual Parameters Fixed or reactive Dynamic at runtime Usage Display data reactively Actions on user interaction Return Reactive properties Promise

Summary: Imperative Apex gives you full control over when and how Apex methods are called from your LWC. It‚Äôs essential for actions like approving/rejecting applications, where you only want to call Apex when a user clicks a button, not automatically on component load.

‚Ä¢ Use Case in Portal: ‚Ä¢ Candidate clicks "Apply Now" ‚Üí Imperative call inserts new Application__c record. ‚Ä¢ Employer rejects candidate ‚Üí Imperative call updates Application__c status. ‚Ä¢ Implementation: ‚Ä¢ applyForJob({ candidateId, jobId }) method invoked via imperative call. ‚Ä¢ Success/error handled with toast messages.

Navigation Service Navigation Service enables smooth navigation between Salesforce pages. The Lightning Navigation Service in LWC allows you to navigate to different Salesforce pages programmatically, such as: ‚Ä¢ Record pages ‚Ä¢ Object list views ‚Ä¢ Web pages (external URLs) ‚Ä¢ Custom tabs / components It‚Äôs similar to routing in traditional web apps but adapted for Salesforce Lightning.
1 Key Concepts ‚Ä¢ You import NavigationMixin from lightning/navigation. ‚Ä¢ Use thisNavigationMixin.Navigate to navigate. ‚Ä¢ pageReference is a JavaScript object describing the target page.

2 Example Usage a) Import NavigationMixin import { LightningElement } from 'lwc'; import { NavigationMixin } from 'lightning/navigation'; export default class MyComponent extends NavigationMixin(LightningElement) { navigateToRecord() { // Code here } } b) Navigate to a Record Page this[NavigationMixin.Navigate]({ type: 'standard__recordPage', attributes: { recordId: '0015g00000XXXXXX', // replace with actual record Id objectApiName: 'Account', actionName: 'view' } }); Explanation: ‚Ä¢ type: 'standard__recordPage' ‚Üí standard Salesforce record page ‚Ä¢ recordId ‚Üí the record you want to view ‚Ä¢ objectApiName ‚Üí object API name ‚Ä¢ actionName ‚Üí 'view', 'edit', 'clone'

c) Navigate to an Object List View this[NavigationMixin.Navigate]({ type: 'standard__objectPage', attributes: { objectApiName: 'Application__c', actionName: 'list' }, state: { filterName: 'All' // optional: filter list view } });

d) Navigate to a Web Page (External URL) this[NavigationMixin.Navigate]({ type: 'standard__webPage', attributes: { url: 'https://www.salesforce.com' } });

3 Integration Example You could add a button in your JobCard LWC: And JS: viewCandidate() { this[NavigationMixin.Navigate]({ type: 'standard__recordPage', attributes: { recordId: this.job.Candidate__c, objectApiName: 'Candidate__c', actionName: 'view' } }); } ‚Ä¢ Clicking this button will navigate to the candidate‚Äôs record page.

4 Notes ‚Ä¢ Always extend NavigationMixin in your component class. ‚Ä¢ NavigationMixin.GenerateUrl can generate a URL without navigating immediately. ‚Ä¢ Works for standard and custom objects, record pages, web pages, and app pages.

‚Ä¢ Use Case in Portal: ‚Ä¢ Candidate clicks on "View Job" ‚Üí Redirects to Job Record Page. ‚Ä¢ Employer clicks on "View Candidate" ‚Üí Redirects to Candidate Record Page. ‚Ä¢ Implementation: ‚Ä¢ NavigationMixin.Navigate used in LWC to move between record pages, list views, or custom tabs.

Conclusion ÔÉ∞ Phase 6 ensures that the Skill Development and Employment Portal is not only functionally strong but also visually intuitive, responsive, and user-friendly. Using Salesforce UI capabilities (App Builder, Record Pages, Tabs, Utility Bar) along with Lightning Web Components integrated with Apex, we provide a seamless candidate-employer-admin experience. ÔÉ∞ This phase transforms backend data and logic into a real-world, interactive portal that enhances user engagement, simplifies workflows, and bridges the gap between job seekers and employers.

Phase 7: Integration & External Access Objective: To enable the Skill Development and Employment Portal to securely integrate with external systems, provide real-time updates, and support external services while respecting Salesforce limits and security best practices.

Named Credentials o Named Credentials simplify authentication for callouts to external systems by storing endpoint URLs and authentication settings in a secure, reusable way. Purpose in Project: ‚Ä¢ Allow our portal to connect to external skill certification APIs or job listing services without hardcoding credentials in Apex. ‚Ä¢ Makes it easy to switch environments (sandbox vs production). Example: ‚Ä¢ Name: SkillCertAPI ‚Ä¢ URL: https://api.skillcert.com/v1/ ‚Ä¢ Authentication: OAuth 2.0 Usage in Apex: HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest(); req.setEndpoint('callout:SkillCertAPI/getCertification?candidateId=' + candidateId); req.setMethod('GET'); Http http = new Http(); HTTPResponse res = http.send(req);
Use Case in Project: ‚Ä¢ Connect your portal to an external skill certification API (e.g., https://api.skillcert.com) to verify candidate skills. Practical Steps in Salesforce

Create a Named Credential ‚Ä¢ Go to Setup ‚Üí Named Credentials ‚Üí New Named Credential ‚Ä¢ Fill in details: ‚Ä¢ Label: SkillCertAPI ‚Ä¢ Name: SkillCertAPI ‚Ä¢ URL: https://api.skillcert.com/v1/ ‚Ä¢ Identity Type: Named Principal (or per user if needed) ‚Ä¢ Authentication Protocol: OAuth 2.0 ‚Ä¢ Enter Auth Provider (create one if not already) ‚Ä¢ Enter Scope, Client ID, Client Secret if required ‚Ä¢ Generate Authorization Header: ‚úÖ Checked ‚Ä¢ Save the Named Credential.

Test the Named Credential ‚Ä¢ You can click ‚ÄúTest Connection‚Äù if Salesforce allows. ‚Ä¢ Make sure it successfully connects to the external API.

Use in Apex HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest(); req.setEndpoint('callout:SkillCertAPI/getCertification?candidateId=' + candidateId); req.setMethod('GET'); Http http = new Http(); HTTPResponse res = http.send(req); if(res.getStatusCode() == 200){ System.debug('Certification data: ' + res.getBody()); } else { System.debug('Error: ' + res.getStatus()); } Important Notes: ‚Ä¢ The callout: prefix tells Salesforce to use the Named Credential. ‚Ä¢ No credentials or URLs are hardcoded in Apex. ‚Ä¢ If your API requires additional headers, you can add them in the req.setHeader() method.

Step 1: Create an External Credential

Go to Setup ‚Üí External Credentials ‚Üí New.
Fill fields: ‚Ä¢ Label: SkillCertExtCred ‚Ä¢ Name: SkillCertExtCred ‚Ä¢ Authentication Protocol: ‚Üí For testing, choose No Authentication.
Save.
(If in the future you want OAuth 2.0, this is where you‚Äôd configure Client ID, Secret, Token URL, etc.)

Step 2: Map to a Permission Set

Still inside External Credential record, find Principals ‚Üí Click New.
‚Ä¢ Principal Type: Named Principal (one login for everyone). ‚Ä¢ Authentication Parameters: Leave empty (since No Auth). ‚Ä¢ Save.

Assign this External Credential to a Permission Set: ‚Ä¢ Go to Setup ‚Üí Permission Sets ‚Üí New. ‚Ä¢ Create a Permission Set (e.g., SkillCertAPIAccess). ‚Ä¢ In the Permission Set, go to External Credential Principal Access ‚Üí Add
‚Ä¢ your SkillCertExtCred. ‚Ä¢ Assign this Permission Set to your user.

Step 3: Create the Named Credential Now go back to Named Credentials ‚Üí New: ‚Ä¢ Label: SkillCertAPI_Test ‚Ä¢ Name: SkillCertAPI_Test ‚Ä¢ URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com (test API) ‚Ä¢ Enabled for Callouts: ‚úÖ ‚Ä¢ Authentication ‚Üí External Credential: select your SkillCertExtCred. ‚Ä¢ Other fields: leave defaults. ‚Ä¢ Save.

Step 4: Test in Apex HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest(); req.setEndpoint('callout:SkillCertAPI_Test/users'); req.setMethod('GET'); Http http = new Http(); HttpResponse res = http.send(req); System.debug('Status: ' + res.getStatusCode()); System.debug('Body: ' + res.getBody());

SkillCertCalloutTest.makeCallout(); Run this in Execute Anonymous ‚Üí check Debug Logs. You should see JSON response (list of fake users). üéâ

External Services o External Services allow Salesforce to connect with APIs declaratively without writing Apex code. Purpose in Project: ‚Ä¢ Automatically fetch skill endorsements from external platforms for candidates. ‚Ä¢ Simplify integration with job boards for posting vacancies. Implementation Steps:
Register the external API using Named Credentials.
Import the API schema (Swagger/OpenAPI) into Salesforce.
Use Flows or Apex to call the service. Example Use Case: ‚Ä¢ Candidate applies for a course, and external training provider API automatically verifies completion and updates Candidate__c record. ‚Ä¢ External Services in Salesforce let you bring an external API (REST or OpenAPI/Swagger) into Salesforce without writing full Apex code. ‚Ä¢ You register the service using its schema (OpenAPI or WSDL). ‚Ä¢ Salesforce automatically generates Apex Actions that you can use in Flow, Apex, or Process Builder. ‚Ä¢ For your portal, this means you could integrate with external systems like: ‚Ä¢ Certification Verification APIs (to check if a candidate‚Äôs certification is valid). ‚Ä¢ Job Market APIs (to fetch latest job listings). ‚Ä¢ Training Provider APIs (to pull available skill courses).
How to Set It Up (Step-by-Step)

Prepare the API Schema ‚Ä¢ If your external system gives you a Swagger (OpenAPI JSON) file or WSDL, download it. ‚Ä¢ Example: SkillCertAPI.json (OpenAPI spec for a certification validation API).

Go to External Services in Salesforce ‚Ä¢ Setup ‚Üí search for External Services. ‚Ä¢ Click New External Service.

Fill the Details ‚Ä¢ Name: SkillCertServiceExt ‚Ä¢ Named Credential: choose the one you created earlier ‚Üí SkillCertService. ‚Ä¢ Service Schema: upload your OpenAPI (Swagger) or WSDL file.

Save and Register

‚Ä¢ Salesforce will analyze the schema. ‚Ä¢ It generates Apex Invocable Actions automatically. ‚Ä¢ These appear in Flow (drag-and-drop) and can also be called in Apex.

üõ† Example in our Project Imagine you connected an API called CertVerifyAPI that checks if a candidate‚Äôs certificate is valid. After registering: ‚Ä¢ In Flow, you‚Äôll see an action like: CertVerifyAPI.ValidateCertificate

‚Ä¢ You can use it in your Candidate Onboarding Flow: ‚Ä¢ When a candidate uploads a certificate ‚Üí Flow calls the API ‚Üí response stored in Certificate_Status__c field.

Result ‚Ä¢ No need to write full Apex callout code. ‚Ä¢ The API is now a drag-and-drop building block in your portal workflows. ‚Ä¢ Fits perfectly with your Skill Development & Employment Portal idea, since you can integrate with certification and job listing providers.

Web Services (REST/SOAP) REST Services: ‚Ä¢ Provide lightweight, JSON-based integration. ‚Ä¢ Example: Posting new job openings to an external recruitment portal. SOAP Services: ‚Ä¢ Use XML-based integration for legacy systems. ‚Ä¢ Example: Pull candidate background verification data from a partner service. Example REST Apex Callout: HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest(); req.setEndpoint('https://externaljobportal.com/api/jobs'); req.setMethod('POST'); req.setHeader('Content-Type','application/json'); req.setBody(JSON.serialize(jobObj)); // jobObj is Job__c info HttpResponse res = new Http().send(req); Step 1: REST Callout Execution We will use your Named Credential (SkillCertService) and a sample REST API. 1.1: Create Apex Class for REST Callout
Go to Setup ‚Üí Apex Classes ‚Üí New.
1.2: Execute REST Callout

Open Developer Console ‚Üí Execute Anonymous Window.
Run: SkillCertREST.fetchCandidates();
Check Debug Logs: ‚Ä¢ Status Code should be 200 ‚Ä¢ Response Body should show candidate data
Verify in Candidate__c object ‚Üí records created from API response.
Step 2: SOAP Callout Execution SOAP is XML-based. You need WSDL from external system. 2.1: Generate Apex Class from WSDL

Download WSDL file from your external API provider.
In Salesforce: Setup ‚Üí Apex Classes ‚Üí Generate from WSDL.
Salesforce creates Apex classes (e.g., SkillCertSOAP).
2.2: Create Apex Class to Call SOAP API public class SkillCertSOAPCallout { public static void fetchCandidatesSOAP() { SkillCertSOAP.SoapPort service = new SkillCertSOAP.SoapPort(); SkillCertSOAP.CandidateResponse response = service.getCandidates(); System.debug('SOAP Response: ' + response); // Optional: Map response to Salesforce records for(SkillCertSOAP.Candidate c : response.candidates){ Candidate__c rec = new Candidate__c(); rec.Name = c.name; rec.Email__c = c.email; insert rec; } } }

2.3: Execute SOAP Callout

Open Developer Console ‚Üí Execute Anonymous Window.
Run: SkillCertSOAPCallout.fetchCandidatesSOAP();
Check Debug Logs: ‚Ä¢ Response XML is printed ‚Ä¢ Salesforce records are created/updated
Step 3: Tips & Best Practices ‚Ä¢ Named Credential handles authentication ‚Üí no need to manually add headers. ‚Ä¢ @future(callout=true) is needed for callouts from triggers or async operations. ‚Ä¢ Use Debug Logs to verify status codes and responses. ‚Ä¢ Always test with a small number of records before bulk operations.

After this, your portal can fetch candidates, skills, and jobs via REST or SOAP and store them in Salesforce objects.

Callouts Definition: Callouts are outbound requests from Salesforce to external services. A callout is any request Salesforce makes to an external system (REST or SOAP). Callouts can be done:
Synchronously from Apex
Asynchronously using @future(callout=true) or Scheduled Apex
From Flows using Apex Actions
A) REST Callouts from Apex Assuming you have a Named Credential (SkillCertAPI_Test) set up:

‚úÖ Named Credential automatically handles authentication. ‚úÖ callout: prefix tells Salesforce to use the Named Credential endpoint.

B) SOAP Callouts from Apex ‚Ä¢ We already covered SOAP in the previous steps. ‚Ä¢ Ensure you‚Äôre using generated Apex classes from WSDL. ‚Ä¢ Use endpoint_x = 'callout:SkillCertAPI_Test/SkillCertService' to point to the Named Credential.

C) Asynchronous Callouts If you want to trigger callouts from triggers (like when a candidate is created), you must use:

SkillCertAsyncREST.fetchCandidatesAsync();

D) Callouts in Flows

Create an Apex Invocable Method: public class FlowSkillCertREST { @InvocableMethod(label='Fetch Candidates REST') public static void fetchCandidates(List input){ SkillCertRESTCallout.fetchCandidatesREST(); } }
In Flow Builder: ‚Ä¢ Drag Action ‚Üí Apex ‚Ä¢ Select Fetch Candidates REST ‚Ä¢ Call this from a record-triggered flow or scheduled flow.
E) Testing Callouts ‚Ä¢ Open Developer Console ‚Üí Execute Anonymous: SkillCertRESTCallout.fetchCandidatesREST(); ‚Ä¢ Check Debug Logs ‚Ä¢ Verify new Candidate__c records created in Salesforce

Next Step after Callouts: ‚Ä¢ Handle Platform Events and Change Data Capture to sync external data automatically.

Best Practices for Project: ‚Ä¢ Always use Named Credentials. ‚Ä¢ Respect callout limits: Max 100 synchronous callouts per transaction. ‚Ä¢ Handle errors gracefully using try-catch. Example: ‚Ä¢ When a candidate completes a skill test, Salesforce calls the testing platform API to fetch results and update Skill__c records.

Platform Events Definition: Platform Events are Salesforce‚Äôs event-driven architecture mechanism for integrating apps in real-time. Purpose in Project: ‚Ä¢ Notify external systems or internal Flows when a candidate's skill is updated. ‚Ä¢ Enable real-time synchronization with job board updates. Platform Events are custom objects that allow real-time communication between Salesforce and external systems. They are like event messages ‚Äî you can publish events from Salesforce or external systems and subscribe to them to trigger actions.
A) Define Platform Event

Go to Setup ‚Üí Platform Events ‚Üí New Platform Event

Example:

Field Value Label CandidateEvent Plural Label CandidateEvents API Name CandidateEvent__e Publish Behavior Publish After Commit (default)

Add custom fields to store event data:
Field Label API Name Type Candidate Name CandidateName__c Text Email Email__c Email Skills Skills__c Text Action Action__c Text (Created/Updated) Tip: All fields are read-only for subscribers, like messages.

B) Publish Platform Event from Apex Whenever a candidate is created or updated, you can publish a CandidateEvent:

C) Trigger Example to Publish Event trigger CandidateTrigger on Candidate__c (after insert, after update) { for(Candidate__c c : Trigger.new){ String actionType = Trigger.isInsert ? 'Created' : 'Updated'; CandidateEventPublisher.publishCandidateEvent(c, actionType); } } ‚Ä¢ Now every time a candidate record is inserted or updated, a Platform Event is published.

D) Subscribe to Platform Event You can subscribe in Salesforce via:

Process Builder / Flow (Low-Code) ‚Ä¢ Create a New Flow ‚Üí Record-Triggered Flow ‚Ä¢ Event: Platform Event ‚Üí CandidateEvent__e ‚Ä¢ Action: Create/Update record or call Apex

Apex Trigger on Platform Event trigger CandidateEventTrigger on CandidateEvent__e (after insert) { for(CandidateEvent__e event : Trigger.new){ System.debug('Received Event: ' + event.CandidateName__c); // Example: Create a record in another object CandidateLog__c log = new CandidateLog__c( CandidateName__c = event.CandidateName__c, Email__c = event.Email__c, Skills__c = event.Skills__c, Action__c = event.Action__c ); insert log; } } ‚Ä¢ Use Case: Whenever a candidate is added via external API (REST/SOAP callout), you can publish a Platform Event to notify other parts of your portal or external systems in real-time.

E) Test Platform Events

Insert a Candidate__c record
Check Debug Logs ‚Üí see if CandidateEvent__e was published
Check CandidateEvent__e object in Salesforce ‚Üí it stores events for 24 hours
F) Key Points ‚Ä¢ Platform Events are asynchronous ‚Üí they don‚Äôt block record creation ‚Ä¢ Maximum event delivery per 24h ‚Üí check Salesforce limits

Example Event: ‚Ä¢ Event: CandidateSkillUpdated__e ‚Ä¢ Trigger: Candidate skill added or updated ‚Ä¢ Subscriber: External notification system updates candidate profile.

Change Data Capture (CDC) Definition: Change Data Capture publishes changes (create, update, delete, undelete) in Salesforce records in real-time. Change Data Capture (CDC) is a real-time event-based feature that automatically tracks changes (create, update, delete, undelete) on standard or custom objects. Unlike Platform Events, CDC is pre-built for Salesforce objects, so you don‚Äôt need to define custom event fields.
A) Enable Change Data Capture

Go to Setup ‚Üí Change Data Capture
Select the objects you want to track, e.g., Candidate__c, Job__c, Skill__c
Click Enable Now, Salesforce will automatically publish change events for these objects.
B) Subscribe to CDC Events in Apex You can write an Apex trigger on the CDC event object: trigger CandidateCDCTrigger on Candidate__ChangeEvent (after insert) { for(Candidate__ChangeEvent event : Trigger.new){ System.debug('CDC Event Received: ' + event.Candidate__c); System.debug('Change Type: ' + event.ChangeEventHeader.changeType); // Example: Create a log record CandidateLog__c log = new CandidateLog__c( CandidateName__c = event.Name, Email__c = event.Email__c, Skills__c = event.Skill__c, Action__c = String.valueOf(event.ChangeEventHeader.changeType) ); insert log; } } Key Points: ‚Ä¢ Candidate__ChangeEvent is the CDC object corresponding to your custom object Candidate__c. ‚Ä¢ ChangeEventHeader.changeType tells you whether it‚Äôs CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, or UNDELETE. ‚Ä¢ ChangeEventHeader.recordIds gives the ID of the changed record.

C) Subscribe to CDC in Flows

Create a New Flow ‚Üí Record-Triggered Flow ‚Üí Platform Event Trigger
Choose Candidate__ChangeEvent
Add actions like creating a log record, calling Apex, or sending notifications. This is low-code and doesn‚Äôt require Apex if you prefer Flow-based automation.
D) Subscribe to CDC in External Systems ‚Ä¢ CDC events can be consumed outside Salesforce using the CometD/Streaming API. ‚Ä¢ Example use case: When a candidate is updated in Salesforce, an external HR system receives the event immediately.

E) Test Change Data Capture

Insert or update a Candidate__c record
Check Debug Logs ‚Üí CDC trigger fired
Verify CandidateLog__c or other actions triggered by CDC
F) Practical Use in our Portal ‚Ä¢ Whenever candidates, jobs, or skills are updated externally or internally: ‚Ä¢ REST/SOAP Callouts ‚Üí Salesforce ‚Üí Publish Platform Event ‚Üí Update other objects ‚Ä¢ CDC ‚Üí Real-time event ‚Üí Trigger automation in portal or external systems ‚Ä¢ Ensures your Skill Development Portal stays in sync in real-time.

Purpose in Project: ‚Ä¢ Automatically sync candidate profile updates to external HR or training systems. ‚Ä¢ Ensure external systems always have the latest job and skill data. Example Use Case: ‚Ä¢ When a Job__c record is updated, CDC pushes the update to external job boards.

Salesforce Connect ‚Ä¢ Salesforce Connect allows external data to appear in Salesforce without storing it in the platform. Purpose in Project: ‚Ä¢ Show live job vacancies from partner portals directly in Salesforce. ‚Ä¢ Link external candidate skill certifications to Candidate__c without duplication. Implementation Steps:
Define an External Data Source.
Map external objects to Salesforce.
Use External Lookup Relationships in relevant objects. Salesforce Connect allows you to access external data in real-time without storing it in Salesforce. You can view and interact with external objects as if they were native Salesforce objects.
A) Key Concepts Term Description External Object Represents a table in an external system. Similar to a custom object but data resides externally. External Data Source Connection settings to the external system (OData, Salesforce, etc.). OData Protocol supported by Salesforce Connect to read/write data from external sources.

B) Setup Salesforce Connect

Create External Data Source ‚Ä¢ Setup ‚Üí External Data Sources ‚Üí New External Data Source
‚Ä¢ Example: Field Value Data Source Name SkillCertExternalData Type OData 4.0 URL https://api.skillcert.com/odata (replace with your endpoint) Authentication Named Credential ‚Üí SkillCertAPI_Test Identity Type Named Principal Save ‚Üí Validate and Sync 2. Validate and Sync External Objects ‚Ä¢ Click Validate and Sync ‚Ä¢ Salesforce fetches metadata from the external system ‚Ä¢ Select objects like Candidates, Jobs, Skills ‚Üí Sync

External Objects in Salesforce ‚Ä¢ These appear under External Objects in Object Manager ‚Ä¢ You can create list views, reports, and relationships like custom objects
C) Access External Data ‚Ä¢ Tabular View: Add External Object tabs ‚Üí Users can see external data in Salesforce UI ‚Ä¢ Apex Access: List<Candidate__x> candidates = [SELECT Name, Email__c, Skill__c FROM Candidate__x LIMIT 10]; System.debug(candidates); _x suffix indicates external object

D) Practical Use in Your Portal ‚Ä¢ Your Skill Development Portal can display external candidates, jobs, and skills in real-time without storing them in Salesforce. ‚Ä¢ Combine with Flows or Apex to perform actions on external data.

E) Key Points

Read/Write depends on the external system and permissions
No storage limits in Salesforce ‚Äî data remains external
Real-time access ensures portal always shows latest data
API Limits
Salesforce enforces limits on API calls to prevent abuse and maintain performance. Project Relevance: ‚Ä¢ Ensure external integrations like skill certification API or job board API do not exceed daily limits. ‚Ä¢ Example: 15,000 calls/day in Enterprise Edition. Best Practices: ‚Ä¢ Use batching and Platform Events to minimize API usage. ‚Ä¢ Monitor usage via Setup ‚Üí API Usage. API limits control how many API calls your org can make in a 24-hour period. Every REST/SOAP callout, Apex callout, Salesforce Connect request, or external system request counts toward limits.

A) Why API Limits Matter ‚Ä¢ Avoid hitting limits ‚Üí your integrations fail temporarily ‚Ä¢ Keep your REST/SOAP callouts and CDC/Platform Event usage optimized ‚Ä¢ Salesforce enforces different limits for Enterprise, Developer, and Unlimited Editions

B) Types of API Calls Counting Toward Limits API Call Counts toward limit? REST API callouts ‚úÖ SOAP API callouts ‚úÖ Bulk API ‚úÖ Streaming API (CDC / Platform Events) ‚úÖ Salesforce Connect via OData ‚úÖ Tooling API / Metadata API ‚úÖ

C) Check API Usage

System Overview ‚Ä¢ Setup ‚Üí System Overview ‚Üí Check API Requests Used

API Usage Logs ‚Ä¢ Setup ‚Üí API Usage Notifications ‚Ä¢ Setup ‚Üí Debug Logs ‚Üí Filter by API

Apex Code Check Limits.getLimitCallouts(); // Total allowed callouts Limits.getCallouts(); // Callouts used in current transaction

Example in REST callout Apex: System.debug('Total allowed callouts: ' + Limits.getLimitCallouts()); System.debug('Callouts used: ' + Limits.getCallouts());

D) Best Practices to Avoid Hitting Limits

Batch Callouts ‚Ä¢ Combine multiple REST/SOAP calls in one request if API allows
Use Named Credentials ‚Ä¢ Reduces repeated authentication overhead
Asynchronous Processing ‚Ä¢ Use @future(callout=true), Queueable, or Batch Apex
Platform Events / CDC ‚Ä¢ Prefer events instead of polling external APIs frequently
Monitor Usage ‚Ä¢ Use Scheduled Apex to log API usage ‚Ä¢ Alert admin when usage approaches 75% of limit
E) Example: Monitor API Usage in Apex public class APILimitMonitor { public static void checkLimits() { System.debug('Total Callouts Allowed: ' + Limits.getLimitCallouts()); System.debug('Callouts Used in this transaction: ' + Limits.getCallouts()); } } ‚Ä¢ You can schedule this daily to ensure your portal doesn‚Äôt hit limits.

OAuth & Authentication
OAuth is a secure authorization protocol to access external systems without sharing credentials. OAuth (Open Authorization) is a secure protocol that allows your Salesforce org to access external APIs without storing user passwords. It‚Äôs widely used for REST/SOAP integrations and Salesforce Connect.

A) Why OAuth Matters ‚Ä¢ Secure authentication without exposing credentials ‚Ä¢ Supports token-based access (Access Token / Refresh Token) ‚Ä¢ Works with Named Credentials, which simplifies callouts

B) OAuth Flow Types OAuth Flow Use Case Username-Password Flow Simple server-to-server integration (use cautiously) Web Server Flow For apps requiring user login and consent JWT Bearer Token Flow Server-to-server, no interactive login Refresh Token Flow Automatically refresh access token without user login For your Skill Development Portal, JWT or Named Credential with OAuth is recommended for secure REST/SOAP callouts.

C) Configure OAuth in Named Credential

Go to Setup ‚Üí Named Credentials ‚Üí New
Example configuration: Field Value Label SkillCertAPI_OAuth URL https://api.skillcert.com Identity Type Named Principal Authentication Protocol OAuth 2.0 Authentication Provider Create new (if not already) Scope read write (as required by API) Start Authentication Flow on Save Checked
Create Authentication Provider (if using OAuth) ‚Ä¢ Setup ‚Üí Auth. Providers ‚Üí New ‚Ä¢ Provider Type: Custom or Web Server ‚Ä¢ Consumer Key & Secret: Provided by external system ‚Ä¢ Callback URL: Generated by Salesforce
Save Named Credential ‚Üí Salesforce handles OAuth token management automatically
D) Use OAuth Named Credential in Apex Callouts Http http = new Http(); HttpRequest request = new HttpRequest(); request.setEndpoint('callout:SkillCertAPI_OAuth/candidates'); request.setMethod('GET'); request.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json'); HttpResponse response = http.send(request); System.debug('OAuth REST Response: ' + response.getBody()); Salesforce automatically adds the Authorization header with the access token.

E) Refresh Tokens (Optional) ‚Ä¢ Named Credentials manage refresh tokens automatically ‚Ä¢ If using manual Apex, you can refresh the token via OAuth endpoint: // Example: POST to token endpoint with refresh_token, client_id, client_secret Usually unnecessary if using Named Credentials.

F) Security Best Practices

Never hardcode client secrets or passwords in Apex
Use Named Credentials + OAuth whenever possible
Limit scope to only what your portal needs (read, write)
Audit API usage regularly to avoid abuse
Project Implementation: ‚Ä¢ Connect to external training or job portals securely. ‚Ä¢ Use OAuth 2.0 Named Credentials for REST API authentication. Example Flow:

Portal requests access token via OAuth.
Salesforce stores token in Named Credential.
Use token in API callouts automatically.
Remote Site Settings Definition: Salesforce requires all external endpoints to be whitelisted in Remote Site Settings for security. Remote Site Settings allow Salesforce to connect to external URLs. Any REST/SOAP callout to an external system must either use: ‚Ä¢ Named Credentials (recommended) ‚Äì no separate Remote Site required ‚Ä¢ Or Remote Site Settings if not using Named Credentials
A) Add a Remote Site

Go to Setup ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Remote Site Settings ‚Üí New Remote Site
Example configuration: Field Value Remote Site Name SkillCertAPI Remote Site URL https://api.skillcert.com Description REST/SOAP endpoints for Skill Certification API Active Checked
Save ‚Üí Salesforce can now make callouts to this URL
B) Best Practices

Use Named Credentials whenever possible ‚Äì handles authentication and headers automatically
Limit URLs ‚Äì only add domains required by your portal
Secure HTTPS URLs ‚Äì Salesforce requires SSL endpoints for callouts
C) Test Callouts After Remote Site Setting

Go to Developer Console ‚Üí Execute Anonymous: Http http = new Http(); HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest(); req.setEndpoint('https://api.skillcert.com/candidates'); // or callout:SkillCertAPI_Test if Named Credential req.setMethod('GET'); HttpResponse res = http.send(req); System.debug(res.getBody());

If successful ‚Üí Salesforce can reach external endpoints

If error: System.CalloutException: You have not defined a remote site setting for this URL ‚Üí add Remote Site

D) Practical Tip for Your Portal ‚Ä¢ For Skill Development & Employment Portal, every external REST/SOAP API endpoint (like SkillCert API) must be either: ‚Ä¢ Configured in a Named Credential ‚Üí preferred ‚Ä¢ Or added in Remote Site Settings ‚Üí fallback ‚Ä¢ This ensures all callouts for candidate/job/skill syncing work without security errors.

Project Implementation: ‚Ä¢ Add URLs like: ‚Ä¢ https://api.skillcert.com ‚Ä¢ https://externaljobportal.com ‚Ä¢ Ensures Apex callouts succeed without security errors.

Integration Workflow ‚Äì Example for Project Scenario: Candidate completes a new skill certification, and we want to update portal and external systems automatically.
Candidate passes skill test ‚Üí Skill__c record created.
Platform Event CandidateSkillUpdated__e is published.
External systems subscribed to event fetch the data via Change Data Capture.
Apex callout to external skill API verifies certificate using Named Credential.
Job boards updated using REST API callout with OAuth authentication.
All external endpoints validated in Remote Site Settings.
Security Considerations ‚Ä¢ Use Named Credentials to avoid hardcoding credentials. ‚Ä¢ Limit external API access using OAuth scopes. ‚Ä¢ Ensure callouts handle timeouts and errors gracefully. ‚Ä¢ Monitor API usage to avoid exceeding API limits.
Summary Table Feature Purpose in Project Key Objects / Records Named Credentials Secure API access Skill__c, Job__c External Services Declarative integration Candidate__c Web Services (REST/SOAP) Push/pull data from external portals Job__c, Skill__c Callouts Trigger external actions Candidate__c, Job__c Platform Events Real-time notifications CandidateSkillUpdated__e Change Data Capture Real-time record sync Job__c, Candidate__c Salesforce Connect Access external data without duplication Job__c, Candidate__c API Limits Prevent system overload All integrated APIs OAuth & Authentication Secure connection to external services Job Boards, Skill APIs Remote Site Settings Whitelist endpoints for callouts All external endpoints

This Phase 7 ties with our previous objects and flows and provides practical examples relevant to our Skill Development and Employment Portal Project.

Phase 8: Data Management & Deployment

Data Import Wizard o The Data Import Wizard is Salesforce‚Äôs point-and-click tool for importing simple data into standard and custom objects. üîπ How we applied it in our project: ‚Ä¢ Imported candidate details (Candidate__c) such as Name, Email, Phone, and Address. ‚Ä¢ Bulk uploaded Skills and Certifications related to candidates for initial setup. ‚Ä¢ Mapped columns in CSV files to Salesforce fields to ensure data accuracy. Key Points: ‚Ä¢ Supports up to 50,000 records at a time. ‚Ä¢ Provides field mapping for custom objects (like our Candidate__c, Skill__c, and Job__c). ‚Ä¢ Suitable for administrators with minimal technical skills.
(Import candidate, skill & job data)

Go to Setup ‚Üí Data Import Wizard.
Select the object: ‚Ä¢ Candidate__c (custom object). ‚Ä¢ Skill__c (skills for candidates). ‚Ä¢ Job__c (job openings).
Click Launch Wizard.
Upload CSV file (example: candidates.csv). FirstName,LastName,Email,Phone,Location Rupa,Sree,rupa@example.com,9876543210,Hyderabad Arjun,Kumar,arjun@example.com,9876500000,Bangalore

Start Import.

Monitor progress in Bulk Data Load Jobs. For Candidate Object=>

For Job Object=>

Application object=>

üëâ In our portal: This is used for initial candidate data load and bulk skill uploads from Excel sheets given by admin.

We even get a mail after a successful import=>

Here we can see the records updated in our application object directly through csv file import=>

Data Loader o The Data Loader is a client application for bulk importing, updating, deleting, and exporting records. üîπ How we applied it in our project: ‚Ä¢ Imported large datasets of candidates and job openings. ‚Ä¢ Used Export functionality to generate reports of candidate-job matching data for backup. ‚Ä¢ Updated multiple records for skills and job assignments during testing. Data Loader is a client application (separate from Salesforce UI) used for bulk data operations. Unlike Data Import Wizard (limit: 50k records), Data Loader supports up to 5 million records.
When to Use Data Loader ‚Ä¢ Importing large volumes of data (e.g., all Candidates, Jobs, Skills at once). ‚Ä¢ Performing complex mappings or scheduled imports/exports. ‚Ä¢ Updating or deleting specific record sets using IDs. ‚Ä¢ Exporting data for backup or migration.

Steps to Use Data Loader

Download & Install ‚Ä¢ Go to Setup ‚Üí Data Loader (search in Quick Find).
‚Ä¢ Download the version for Windows or Mac. ‚Ä¢ Install it on your system.

Login ‚Ä¢ Open Data Loader app. ‚Ä¢ Enter Salesforce username + password + security token.
‚Ä¢ Choose environment: ‚Ä¢ Production (login.salesforce.com) 3. Choose Operation ‚Ä¢ Options: ‚Ä¢ Insert ‚Üí Add new records. ‚Ä¢ Update ‚Üí Modify existing records. ‚Ä¢ Upsert ‚Üí Insert new + Update existing. ‚Ä¢ Delete ‚Üí Remove records. ‚Ä¢ Export/Export All ‚Üí Download data for backup. 4. Select Object ‚Ä¢ Example: Candidate__c ‚Ä¢ Browse and upload your CSV file.

Map Fields ‚Ä¢ Data Loader will auto-map based on headers. ‚Ä¢ Unmapped fields ‚Üí manually drag & drop. ‚Ä¢ Save the mapping for reuse.

Run the Job ‚Ä¢ Choose a folder for Success.csv & Error.csv logs. ‚Ä¢ Click Next ‚Üí Finish.

‚Ä¢ Data Loader will process all rows and give logs.

Verify ‚Ä¢ Go to Salesforce ‚Üí open object tab (e.g., Candidates). ‚Ä¢ Cross-check record counts and imported data.
Example in our Skill Development Portal Project: ‚Ä¢ Import Jobs.csv ‚Üí into Job__c. ‚Ä¢ Import Skills.csv ‚Üí into Skill__c. ‚Ä¢ Import Candidate_Skills.csv ‚Üí into junction object linking Candidates and Skills.

Key Points: ‚Ä¢ Supports millions of records. ‚Ä¢ Can schedule data loads for automation. ‚Ä¢ Allows upsert operations (update + insert).

Duplicate Rules o To maintain clean candidate and employer data, Duplicate Rules were defined. o Duplicate Rules help prevent or alert users about duplicate records in Salesforce. This is especially important for your Skill Development & Employment Portal, so you don‚Äôt accidentally have multiple records for the same candidate, job, or student.
Step 1: Go to Duplicate Rules

In Salesforce Setup ‚Üí Quick Find ‚Üí type Duplicate Rules.
Click Duplicate Rules under Data ‚Üí Duplicate Management.
You‚Äôll see existing rules (e.g., Lead, Account, Contact).
Step 2: Create a New Duplicate Rule

Click New Rule.
Select Object: ‚Ä¢ Example: Candidate (Candidate__c)
Fill in basic info: ‚Ä¢ Rule Name: Candidate Duplicate Rule ‚Ä¢ Description: ‚ÄúPrevents duplicate candidate records based on Email or Contact Number.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ Record-Level Security: Choose who the rule applies to (All Users / Admins Only).
Activation: Don‚Äôt activate yet until testing.
Step 3: Define Matching Rule ‚Ä¢ Duplicate Rules use Matching Rules to decide if two records are duplicates.

Click Create New Matching Rule (or use existing).

Select Object: Candidate__c

Matching Criteria: ‚Ä¢ Email__c ‚Üí Exact Match ‚Ä¢ ContactNumber__c ‚Üí Exact Match

Save & Activate the matching rule.

Step 4: Complete Duplicate Rule

Back in the Duplicate Rule setup: ‚Ä¢ Actions on Create / Edit: ‚Ä¢ Block ‚Üí Prevent saving a duplicate ‚Ä¢ Alert ‚Üí Warn the user but allow save ‚Ä¢ Example: Choose Alert so users are warned about duplicate candidates.
Optional: ‚Ä¢ Report on duplicate records found ‚Ä¢ Email notifications to admins
Save the rule.
Step 5: Test the Rule

Go to Candidate Tab ‚Üí Create New Candidate.
Enter a candidate with an existing Email or Contact Number.
Salesforce will warn you (or block) according to your rule.
ÔÉ®The above screen shows that entering email or contact number that already exists raised an error to review and didn‚Äôt allow to save due to our duplicate rule on candidate object üîπ How we applied it in our project: ‚Ä¢ Created a rule on Candidate__c to prevent duplicate entries by Email ID. ‚Ä¢ Configured alerts for recruiters when attempting to add duplicate job openings. Key Points: ‚Ä¢ Prevents bad data quality. ‚Ä¢ Can be set to Block or Allow with Alert. ‚Ä¢ Uses Matching Rules behind the scenes.

Data Export & Backup o Data safety was ensured by enabling Data Export Service for backups. o Data Export & Backup ensures your Salesforce data is safe, recoverable, and portable. For your Skill Development & Employment Portal, this is crucial to protect Candidates, Jobs, Skills, and Applications data.
Step 1: Go to Data Export

In Salesforce Setup ‚Üí Quick Find, type Data Export.
Click Data Export under Data Management.
Step 2: Choose Export Type

Manual Export ‚Äì one-time export.
Schedule Export ‚Äì recurring weekly or monthly backups. For initial backup, select Manual Export.
Step 3: Select Data

You‚Äôll see a list of all objects: ‚Ä¢ Candidates, Jobs, Applications, Skills, Students, etc.
Check the objects you want to export. ‚Ä¢ For example: Candidate__c, Job__c, Application__c, Skill__c
Choose options: ‚Ä¢ Include all data ‚Ä¢ Include attachments (if needed) ‚Ä¢ Include Salesforce Files (optional)
Step 4: Start Export

Click Start Export.
Salesforce will prepare a ZIP file with your CSV files for each object.
Once ready, Salesforce will email you a download link. Large data may take a few minutes to hours depending on volume.
Step 5: Download & Store

Download the ZIP file from the link in your email.
Store it in a safe location (local drive or cloud storage).
You can now open CSVs for backup, offline analysis, or re-import if needed.
Step 6: Optional ‚Äì Schedule Recurring Backups ‚Ä¢ Click Schedule Export ‚Üí set frequency (Weekly / Monthly). ‚Ä¢ Salesforce will automatically send the export ZIP to your email. üîπ How we applied it in our project: ‚Ä¢ Exported weekly backups of all candidate, job, and employer data. ‚Ä¢ Downloaded CSV files and stored securely for recovery. Key Points: ‚Ä¢ Provides data in CSV format. ‚Ä¢ Can be scheduled (weekly/monthly). ‚Ä¢ Essential for disaster recovery.

Change Sets o Change Sets were used to migrate customizations between environments. o Change Sets allow you to deploy customizations from one Salesforce org to another (e.g., from Sandbox ‚Üí Production). This is crucial for your Skill Development & Employment Portal when moving objects, fields, or Lightning components after testing.
"The Change Sets process is being skipped due to the unavailability of a Sandbox org login and will be implemented in a subsequent next processes."

Key Points: ‚Ä¢ Works only between connected Salesforce orgs. ‚Ä¢ Best for deploying metadata (not data).

Unmanaged vs Managed Packages o Packages helped organize and share project components. o Salesforce Packages allow you to bundle and distribute metadata (custom objects, fields, flows, Lightning components, etc.) between orgs. This is especially useful when Change Sets aren‚Äôt available.
Unmanaged Packages Definition: ‚Ä¢ A package that contains customizations you can install in another org. ‚Ä¢ Once installed, the components are editable in the target org. Use Case: ‚Ä¢ Ideal for Developer Edition projects like your Skill Development & Employment Portal. Pros: ‚Ä¢ Easy to create and install. ‚Ä¢ Editable in target org after installation. ‚Ä¢ No Sandbox required. Cons: ‚Ä¢ No version control or upgrade path. ‚Ä¢ Cannot easily uninstall everything (components remain).
Managed Packages Definition: ‚Ä¢ A package created for distribution via AppExchange. ‚Ä¢ Components are locked/protected, and updates can be pushed by the provider. Use Case: ‚Ä¢ Ideal for commercial apps that are distributed to multiple orgs. Pros: ‚Ä¢ Upgradeable. ‚Ä¢ Components can be hidden or protected. ‚Ä¢ Supports licensing and versioning. Cons: ‚Ä¢ Cannot edit core components in target org. ‚Ä¢ More complex to create and maintain. 4.Steps to Create an Unmanaged Package (Practical) Step 1: Go to Package Manager
In Setup ‚Üí Package Manager.
Click New Package.
Step 2: Enter Package Details

Package Name: e.g., SkillDevPortal_Components
Description: ‚ÄúContains custom objects, fields, flows, and Lightning components for the Skill Development & Employment Portal project.‚Äù
Package Type: Select Unmanaged Package ‚Ä¢ This allows you to edit components in the target org after installation.
Click Save
Step 3: Add Components

After saving, click Add Components.
Select the component types you want to include: ‚Ä¢ Custom Objects: Candidate__c, Job__c, Skills__c ‚Ä¢ Fields & Relationships within these objects ‚Ä¢ Validation Rules ‚Ä¢ Flows, Lightning Components, Record Types
Add all required components ‚Üí click Add to Package
Step 4: Upload the Package

Once all components are added, click Upload.

Select the target org version (optional).

Salesforce generates an installation URL.

Copy the URL ‚Üí open it in the target org ‚Üí click Install.

Step 5: Verify Installation

Log in to the target org.
Go to Setup ‚Üí Installed Packages.
Check that SkillDevPortal_Components is installed and all objects/components are available.
üîπ How we applied it in our project: ‚Ä¢ Unmanaged Package: Shared our project internally for testing. ‚Ä¢ Managed Package (Future Scope): To distribute the Skill Portal as a product for external organizations. Key Points: ‚Ä¢ Unmanaged ‚Üí editable, good for development. ‚Ä¢ Managed ‚Üí locked, versioned, suitable for AppExchange.

ANT Migration Tool The ANT Migration Tool was explored for CI/CD automation. Key Points: ‚Ä¢ Command-line tool. ‚Ä¢ Supports scripted deployments. ‚Ä¢ Useful for large projects with frequent changes.
VS Code & SFDX Salesforce DX (SFDX) with VS Code was used as our main development environment. Step 1: Install Prerequisites

Install VS Code (already installed in your case).

Install Salesforce CLI (SFDX) ‚Ä¢ Download from Salesforce CLI. ‚Ä¢ After installation, confirm in terminal: sfdx --version

Install Salesforce Extensions for VS Code ‚Ä¢ Open VS Code ‚Üí Extensions ‚Üí Search Salesforce Extension Pack ‚Üí Install. We have already installed it in our earlier steps

üîπ Step 2: Authorize Salesforce Org

Open VS Code ‚Üí Terminal.
Run: sfdx force:auth:web:login -d -a MySandbox ‚Ä¢ -d ‚Üí sets as default org ‚Ä¢ -a ‚Üí alias name (example: MySandbox)
A browser window opens ‚Üí login with Sandbox/Production credentials.
After success ‚Üí your org is now linked to VS Code.
üîπ Step 3: Create/Clone Project ‚Ä¢ To create a new SFDX project: sfdx force:project:create -n SkillPortal ‚Ä¢ To open existing project ‚Üí File ‚Üí Open Folder ‚Üí select your project. ‚Ä¢ If already connected with GitHub (like your TCS_mile branch), just open that folder.

üîπ Step 4: Retrieve Components from Org Example: Retrieve all metadata (classes, lwc, objects, etc.): sfdx force:source:retrieve -m ApexClass sfdx force:source:retrieve -m LightningComponentBundle sfdx force:source:retrieve -m CustomObject Or full org metadata: sfdx force:source:retrieve -u MySandbox -x manifest/package.xml

Open your project folder in VS Code (SkillDevEmploymentPortal).
In the terminal, make sure you‚Äôre on the correct branch: git checkout TCS_mile
Add all changes: git add .
Commit your changes: git commit -m "Updated Skill Development & Employment Portal with latest Salesforce changes"
Push to GitHub: git push origin TCS_mile
‚ö° This phase ensures you can code, test, and sync your Salesforce project directly from VS Code, instead of relying only on the web UI.and changes had hit into github.

üîπ How we applied it in our project: ‚Ä¢ Pulled metadata and pushed changes between Sandbox & VS Code. ‚Ä¢ Used Scratch Orgs for isolated development and testing. ‚Ä¢ Integrated with GitHub (TCS_mile branch ‚Üí future renamed) for source control. ‚Ä¢ Executed SFDX commands for deployment and retrieval. Key Points: ‚Ä¢ Developer-friendly CLI-based tool. ‚Ä¢ Encourages source-driven development. ‚Ä¢ Supports continuous integration (CI/CD) with pipelines.

Outcomes of Phase 8 ‚Ä¢ Established data integrity with import/export, duplicate rules, and backups. ‚Ä¢ Ensured smooth deployment process with Change Sets, ANT, and SFDX. ‚Ä¢ Project is now deployment-ready, with both admin-friendly and developer-friendly tools available. ‚Ä¢ Laid foundation for scalable product distribution via Managed Packages.

Phase 9: Reporting, Dashboards & Security Review

Introduction o In this phase, we focus on analyzing project data, monitoring KPIs, and ensuring security compliance within the Skill Development Employment Portal on Salesforce. Purpose: ‚Ä¢ To provide actionable insights into candidate progress, certifications, skills, and job applications. ‚Ä¢ To ensure data privacy and security for candidates and employers. ‚Ä¢ To enable decision-making for HR managers, recruiters, and training coordinators.

Scope: ‚Ä¢ Creating reports and dashboards to track recruitment and training metrics. ‚Ä¢ Implementing dynamic dashboards for role-based visibility. ‚Ä¢ Configuring sharing settings, field-level security, session management, login IP ranges, and audit trails.

Key Users: ‚Ä¢ HR Managers ‚Ä¢ Recruiters ‚Ä¢ Training Coordinators ‚Ä¢ System Administrators

Reports o Reports in Salesforce provide a way to organize, filter, and present data from objects like Candidate__c, Job__c, Certification__c, and Skill__c. Types of Reports:
Tabular Reports ‚Ä¢ Displays data in rows and columns (like Excel). ‚Ä¢ Use Case: List all candidates who have completed a specific certification.
Summary Reports ‚Ä¢ Includes groupings, subtotals, and charts. ‚Ä¢ Use Case: Group candidates by Skill__c and show how many have advanced-level proficiency.
Matrix Reports ‚Ä¢ Summarizes data by rows and columns. ‚Ä¢ Use Case: Compare number of candidates certified by Certification Name vs. Job Role.
Joined Reports ‚Ä¢ Combines multiple report blocks with different objects. ‚Ä¢ Use Case: Show job openings (from Job__c) alongside candidates applying (from Candidate__c). Implementing Reports in our project We will create reports for the Skill Development Employment Portal using objects like Candidate__c, Job__c, Skill__c, and Certification__c.
Step 1: Navigate to Reports

Login to Salesforce.
Go to App Launcher ‚Üí Reports.
Click New Report.
Step 2: Select Report Type

For candidate-related reports: choose Candidates with Skills (Candidate__c with Skill__c related list).
For job-related reports: choose Jobs with Candidates (Job__c with Candidate__c related list).
Click Continue.
Step 3: Configure Report Filters

Add filters based on your project needs: ‚Ä¢ Example: Show candidates with a specific skill
Filter: Skill Name = Salesforce ‚Ä¢ Example: Show active job postings
Filter: Job Status = Active
Use date filters to track activity: ‚Ä¢ Example: Candidates added this month ‚Üí Created Date = THIS MONTH.
Step 4: Choose Report Format

Tabular: Simple list of candidates or jobs.
Summary: Group by fields like Skill Name or Job Location.
Matrix: Compare candidate count across skills vs. job roles.
Joined: Combine multiple objects if needed (e.g., Job ‚Üí Candidate ‚Üí Skill).
Candidate Applications).
Step 5: Group and Summarize Data (If Required) ‚Ä¢ For Summary/Matrix reports: ‚Ä¢ Drag Skill Name to Group Rows ‚Üí Count of candidates per skill ‚Ä¢ Drag Job Location to Group Columns ‚Üí Compare candidates in each location ‚Ä¢ Summarize key metrics like COUNT of candidates or COUNT of jobs

Step 6: Add Charts (Optional) ‚Ä¢ Click Add Chart ‚Üí choose type: bar, pie, or donut ‚Ä¢ Example: Bar chart showing Number of Candidates per Skill

Step 7: Save & Run the Report

Click Save & Run.
Name the report: ‚Ä¢ Candidates by Skills ‚Ä¢ Active Job Openings
Select Folder: Public Reports / Private Reports
Step 8: Use in Dashboard ‚Ä¢ Reports can be added as components to Dashboards (next phase).

Report Types o Report Types define which objects and relationships are available in reports. ‚Ä¢ Standard Report Types: Auto-generated when relationships exist (e.g., Candidates with Skills). ‚Ä¢ Custom Report Types: Created manually to meet project needs. ‚Ä¢ A report type in Salesforce is like a template that defines: ‚Ä¢ The objects (e.g., Candidate__c, Job__c, Skill__c) that the report will use. ‚Ä¢ The fields available for reporting. ‚Ä¢ The relationships between objects (e.g., Candidates related to Skills, Jobs related to Candidates). Think of it as the foundation for building reports. If the correct report type is not chosen, you won‚Äôt see the fields or objects you need.
Types of Report Types

Standard Report Types ‚Ä¢ Automatically created by Salesforce for standard and custom objects. ‚Ä¢ Example in your project: ‚Ä¢ Candidates (Candidate__c) ‚Ä¢ Jobs (Job__c) ‚Ä¢ Skills (Skill__c)

Custom Report Types ‚Ä¢ Created manually by admins when standard ones don‚Äôt meet requirements. ‚Ä¢ Allows you to define primary object and related objects. ‚Ä¢ Example in your project: ‚Ä¢ Candidates with Skills ‚Üí Shows candidates and their related skills. ‚Ä¢ Jobs with Candidates ‚Üí Shows jobs and candidates applied.

In Our Project=> ‚Ä¢ Use Case 1: HR Manager wants to see candidates grouped by skill. ‚Ä¢ Report Type: Candidates with Skills ‚Ä¢ Use Case 2: Recruiter wants to see how many candidates applied for each job. ‚Ä¢ Report Type: Jobs with Candidates ‚Ä¢ Use Case 3: Training Coordinator wants a list of all candidates regardless of job. ‚Ä¢ Report Type: Candidates (standard).

How to Create a Custom Report Type

Go to Setup ‚Üí Report Types.
Click New Custom Report Type.
Select: ‚Ä¢ Primary Object: Candidate__c ‚Ä¢ Related Object: Skill__c (with ‚ÄúEach Candidate may or may not have related Skills‚Äù).
Save.
This will now appear when creating a new report.
üîπ Example Custom Report Type: Candidates with Certifications and Related Jobs ‚Äì to analyze which certifications directly influence job placement.

Dashboards o Dashboards provide visual insights from multiple reports in one place for stakeholders. o A dashboard in Salesforce is a visual representation of one or more reports. It allows managers, recruiters, and coordinators in your Skill Development Employment Portal to see key metrics at a glance. ‚Ä¢ Reports = Data ‚Ä¢ Dashboard = Visual Story of Data
Key Features ‚Ä¢ Combines multiple reports into a single view. ‚Ä¢ Uses charts, tables, metrics, and gauges. ‚Ä¢ Can be shared with specific roles (HR, Recruiter, Admin). ‚Ä¢ Refresh schedules available (daily, weekly, monthly).

Project-Aligned Dashboard Components

Candidates by Skill (Bar Chart) ‚Ä¢ Source Report: Candidates grouped by Skill__c ‚Ä¢ Use: Helps HR see demand and availability of skills.
Active Job Openings (Metric) ‚Ä¢ Source Report: Active Job__c records ‚Ä¢ Use: Shows how many open jobs are available.
Candidates per Job (Donut Chart) ‚Ä¢ Source Report: Jobs with Candidates ‚Ä¢ Use: Recruiters can track which jobs are receiving applications.
Top Skills in Demand (Pie Chart) ‚Ä¢ Source Report: Candidates with Skills (grouped by Skill Name) ‚Ä¢ Use: Identifies trending skills.
Job Applications Trend (Line Chart) ‚Ä¢ Source Report: Candidate applications over time (Created Date) ‚Ä¢ Use: Shows hiring activity across months.
How to Create a Dashboard

Go to App Launcher ‚Üí Dashboards.
Click New Dashboard.
Enter: ‚Ä¢ Name: Recruitment & Skills Dashboard ‚Ä¢ Folder: Public Dashboards (or private if needed)
Add Components: ‚Ä¢ Click + Component ‚Ä¢ Choose report (e.g., ‚ÄúCandidates by Skills‚Äù) ‚Ä¢ Select chart type (bar, donut, metric, line)
Arrange components in a grid layout.
Save and Run Dashboard.
Best Practices for our Project ‚Ä¢ Keep role-based dashboards: HR vs Recruiter vs Admin. ‚Ä¢ Use clear labels (e.g., ‚ÄúCandidates by Skills‚Äù not ‚ÄúReport1‚Äù). ‚Ä¢ Schedule automatic refresh so managers always see updated data. ‚Ä¢ Use filters to adjust by Job Location, Skill, or Time Period.

Example Dashboard Components for the Project: ‚Ä¢ Bar Chart: Number of candidates by skill category. ‚Ä¢ Donut Chart: Distribution of certifications (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). ‚Ä¢ Table: Active job postings with candidate applications count. ‚Ä¢ Gauge: % of candidates placed vs. target placement rate.

Dynamic Dashboards o Dynamic dashboards allow each user to view data based on their own access rights. o A Dynamic Dashboard in Salesforce shows data tailored to the logged-in user ‚Äî without creating separate dashboards for each role or user. o Instead of making one dashboard for HR, another for Recruiter, another for Manager, you can build one dashboard and set it to ‚ÄúRun as logged-in user.‚Äù
Modes of Running a Dashboard

Run as Specified User (Static Dashboard) ‚Ä¢ Always shows data from the perspective of one user (e.g., Admin). ‚Ä¢ Example: HR Manager sees all candidates.
Run as Logged-in User (Dynamic Dashboard) ‚Ä¢ Each person sees the dashboard with their own permissions and data visibility. ‚Ä¢ Example: ‚Ä¢ Recruiter logs in ‚Üí sees only candidates assigned to them. ‚Ä¢ HR Manager logs in ‚Üí sees all candidates.
Project-Aligned Use Cases

Recruiter View: Sees candidates only for jobs they manage.
HR Manager View: Sees all candidates and jobs across the organization.
Trainer View: Sees candidates grouped by training/skill assigned to them.
How to Create a Dynamic Dashboard

Go to Dashboards ‚Üí New Dashboard (or edit an existing one).
Add required components (reports: Candidates by Skills, Jobs with Candidates, etc.).
In the dashboard Properties: ‚Ä¢ Set ‚ÄúView Dashboard As‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúThe logged-in user‚Äù.
Save the dashboard.
Best Practices ‚Ä¢ Use folder sharing carefully: Only share dashboards with roles that need them. ‚Ä¢ Remember: ‚Ä¢ Enterprise Edition ‚Üí 5 dynamic dashboards limit. ‚Ä¢ Unlimited Edition ‚Üí 10 dynamic dashboards limit. ‚Ä¢ Keep naming clear (e.g., ‚ÄúRecruitment Overview ‚Äì Dynamic‚Äù).

Project Example ‚Ä¢ Dynamic Dashboard Name: Candidate & Job Overview (Dynamic) ‚Ä¢ Recruiter‚Äôs View: ‚Ä¢ Candidates ‚Üí only their assigned ones ‚Ä¢ Jobs ‚Üí only jobs they posted ‚Ä¢ HR Manager‚Äôs View: ‚Ä¢ Candidates ‚Üí all candidates ‚Ä¢ Jobs ‚Üí all jobs

‚Ä¢ Use Case in Project: ‚Ä¢ HR Manager sees all candidates and job postings. ‚Ä¢ Individual Recruiter sees only the candidates and jobs they manage.

Security Review o To ensure data privacy and compliance, we configure sharing and security settings. 5.1 Sharing Settings ‚Ä¢ Private Sharing Model: Candidate details visible only to assigned recruiter/HR. ‚Ä¢ Controlled Sharing Rules: Employers can only see candidate profiles submitted for their jobs. Sharing settings in Salesforce control how records are shared across users, roles, and groups. This ensures that sensitive data is only visible to the right people in your Skill Development Employment Portal.
üîπ Implementation for our Project

Navigate to Sharing Settings ‚Ä¢ Go to Setup ‚Üí search Sharing Settings in Quick Find. ‚Ä¢ Open it.

Choose Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD) ‚Ä¢ For each custom object in your project, set the default access level. ‚Ä¢ Example for your portal objects: ‚Ä¢ Candidate__c (Candidate Profile) ‚Üí Private (so only owner + admin can see). ‚Ä¢ Skill__c (Candidate Skills) ‚Üí Controlled by Parent (linked to Candidate). ‚Ä¢ Job__c (Job Openings) ‚Üí Public Read Only (all can view openings, only owner edits). ‚Ä¢ Application__c (Job Applications) ‚Üí Private (candidate sees only their own application). ‚Ä¢ Employer__c (Company Info) ‚Üí Public Read/Write (HR/Admin can update, recruiters can view).

Create Sharing Rules (if needed) ‚Ä¢ Example rules: ‚Ä¢ Share Candidate Profiles with Recruiters in the same region. ‚Ä¢ Share Job Applications with HR Managers role. ‚Ä¢ Share Training Progress with assigned Trainers.

Test the Sharing Access ‚Ä¢ Log in as: ‚Ä¢ Candidate ‚Üí should only see their profile + applications. ‚Ä¢ Recruiter ‚Üí should only see job openings they posted + candidates who applied. ‚Ä¢ Admin/HR Manager ‚Üí full access to all records.

Candidate data is Private ‚Üí visible only to candidate + assigned recruiter/HR.

Job postings are Public Read Only ‚Üí all candidates can see, recruiters manage their own.

Applications are Private ‚Üí ensures confidentiality of candidate job applications.

Employers are Public ‚Üí recruiters & HR can collaborate.

5.2 Field-Level Security (FLS) ‚Ä¢ Restrict sensitive fields like Candidate_Phone__c, Candidate_Email__c, or Resume_Link__c. ‚Ä¢ Example: HR Admin can see all details, but Training Coordinators cannot see personal contact info. Field-Level Security controls who can see or edit individual fields on an object. Even if a user has access to the record, they may not see all fields if those fields are hidden by FLS. This ensures sensitive information (like salary, contact number, or confidential notes) is protected.

üîπ Implementation in our Project

Navigate to Field-Level Security ‚Ä¢ Go to Setup ‚Üí Object Manager. ‚Ä¢ Select an object (e.g., Candidate__c, Job__c, Application__c). ‚Ä¢ Click Fields & Relationships. ‚Ä¢ Choose the field you want to secure.
Set Field Visibility ‚Ä¢ Inside the field, click Set Field-Level Security. ‚Ä¢ You‚Äôll see a list of Profiles. ‚Ä¢ Uncheck Visible for profiles that should not see this field. ‚Ä¢ You can also control if the field is Read-Only.
Examples for our Project ‚Ä¢ Candidate__c (Candidate Profile) ‚Ä¢ Field: Phone Number ‚Üí visible only to Recruiters & HR, hidden from other Candidates. ‚Ä¢ Field: Email ‚Üí visible to Admin & Recruiters, not editable by Candidates. ‚Ä¢ Job__c (Job Openings) ‚Ä¢ Field: Salary Range ‚Üí visible to Recruiters & HR, hidden from Candidates. ‚Ä¢ Application__c (Job Applications) ‚Ä¢ Field: Recruiter Notes ‚Üí visible only to Recruiters & HR, hidden from Candidates.
Test the FLS ‚Ä¢ Login as a Candidate ‚Üí verify sensitive fields (Salary, Recruiter Notes) are hidden. ‚Ä¢ Login as a Recruiter ‚Üí verify they can see/edit job-related fields. ‚Ä¢ Login as Admin ‚Üí verify full access.
üîπExample ‚Ä¢ Salary Range ‚Üí hidden from Candidates. ‚Ä¢ Recruiter Notes ‚Üí hidden from Candidates, visible to HR/Recruiters. ‚Ä¢ Candidate Phone Number ‚Üí hidden from other Candidates, visible to HR/Recruiters. This ensures data privacy & compliance with security best practices.

5.3 Session Settings o Configure session timeouts (e.g., auto logout after 30 min inactivity). o Enable session security (block concurrent logins for same user). o Session Settings in Salesforce control how long a user can stay logged in, what actions are allowed during a session, and protect against unauthorized access. o They help ensure that candidates, recruiters, and admins use the portal securely and that sensitive data isn‚Äôt exposed due to idle sessions or hijacked sessions.

üîπ How to Configure Session Settings

Navigate to Session Settings ‚Ä¢ Go to Setup ‚Üí Search Session Settings in Quick Find.
Key Configurations
Session Timeout ‚Ä¢ Choose how long a user can stay inactive before being logged out. ‚Ä¢ Example for your project: ‚Ä¢ Candidates ‚Üí 30 minutes timeout. ‚Ä¢ Recruiters & HR ‚Üí 1 hour timeout. ‚Ä¢ Admin ‚Üí 2 hours timeout.
Require Secure Connections (HTTPS) ‚Ä¢ Enable to ensure all sessions use HTTPS (encrypted).
Lock Sessions to IP Address ‚Ä¢ Ensures a session cannot be hijacked by using a different IP.
Enable Clickjack Protection ‚Ä¢ Prevents the portal UI from being embedded in malicious sites.
Force Re-Login after Timeout ‚Ä¢ Ensures the user must log in again if the session expires.
üîπ Example for our Project ‚Ä¢ Candidate Portal Users ‚Üí Timeout = 30 mins (shorter to protect personal data). ‚Ä¢ Recruiters & HR ‚Üí Timeout = 1 hour (enough to review applicants). ‚Ä¢ System Admin ‚Üí Timeout = 2 hours (for long configuration tasks). ‚Ä¢ HTTPS Required ‚Üí Always enabled. ‚Ä¢ Clickjack Protection ‚Üí Enabled for all custom Visualforce & LWC pages.

üîπ Benefits ‚Ä¢ Protects candidate personal data if they forget to log out. ‚Ä¢ Prevents hackers from reusing stolen session IDs. ‚Ä¢ Keeps recruiters‚Äô dashboards and sensitive job data safe.

5.4 Login IP Ranges ‚Ä¢ Restrict logins to corporate network IPs. ‚Ä¢ Example: Only allow HR Managers to access Salesforce from company premises. Login IP Ranges in Salesforce control from which IP addresses users can log in. This ensures that only users accessing the portal from approved locations (office, VPN, or trusted networks) can log in.

üîπ How to Configure Login IP Ranges

Navigate to Profiles ‚Ä¢ Go to Setup ‚Üí Profiles. ‚Ä¢ Select the Profile you want to configure (e.g., Candidate, Recruiter, HR, Admin).
Set Login IP Ranges ‚Ä¢ Scroll down to Login IP Ranges. ‚Ä¢ Click New. ‚Ä¢ Enter: ‚Ä¢ Start IP Address ‚Üí first IP in the allowed range ‚Ä¢ End IP Address ‚Üí last IP in the allowed range ‚Ä¢ Click Save. Example for your project: ‚Ä¢ Recruiter & HR ‚Üí Office VPN range: 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.255 ‚Ä¢ Candidates ‚Üí No restriction (or specific trusted IP range if using internal portal) ‚Ä¢ Admin ‚Üí Restricted to corporate IP only
üîπ Optional: Use Login Hours ‚Ä¢ You can also restrict Login Hours per profile to prevent logins outside business hours. ‚Ä¢ Example: Recruiters ‚Üí 8 AM to 8 PM only.

üîπ Benefits ‚Ä¢ Prevents unauthorized access from unknown locations. ‚Ä¢ Adds another layer of security for sensitive candidate and job data. ‚Ä¢ Combined with Session Settings ‚Üí ensures portal security from both session hijacks and rogue IP access.

5.5 Audit Trail ‚Ä¢ Tracks changes in configurations and admin actions. ‚Ä¢ Example: Record when a field like Placement_Status__c is modified or a new sharing rule is created. ‚Ä¢ Audit Trail in Salesforce records all configuration and setup changes made in your org. It helps track who changed what and when, which is critical for security and compliance. ‚Ä¢ Example in our project: ‚Ä¢ If a Recruiter edits a candidate record or a Job Posting, Audit Trail can help you see the change history.

üîπ Types of Audit Trails

Setup Audit Trail ‚Ä¢ Tracks changes to Salesforce setup/configuration (profiles, roles, fields, permissions, workflow rules, etc.). ‚Ä¢ Retains last 180 days of changes.
Field History Tracking ‚Ä¢ Tracks changes to specific fields on an object. ‚Ä¢ Example for your project: ‚Ä¢ Track Candidate Status on Candidate__c ‚Ä¢ Track Application Status on Application__c
Login History ‚Ä¢ Shows who logged in, when, and from which IP.
üîπ How to Enable Audit Trail

Setup Audit Trail ‚Ä¢ Go to Setup ‚Üí View Setup Audit Trail. ‚Ä¢ You‚Äôll see the last 180 days of setup changes automatically. ‚Ä¢ You can download the CSV for documentation or compliance.

Field History Tracking

Go to Setup ‚Üí Object Manager ‚Üí Candidate__c (or any object).

Click Fields & Relationships ‚Üí Select the field ‚Üí Set History Tracking.

Check the fields you want to track ‚Üí Save.

A new Candidate History related list will appear on the object page.

Login History ‚Ä¢ Go to Setup ‚Üí Login History. ‚Ä¢ Shows login attempts, successes, failures, and IP addresses.

üîπ Benefits ‚Ä¢ Helps identify unauthorized changes. ‚Ä¢ Provides compliance reports for HR or IT audits. ‚Ä¢ Maintains transparency and accountability for all users.

Benefits of This Phase ‚Ä¢ Reports & Dashboards: Clear visibility into candidate-job matching progress. ‚Ä¢ Dynamic Dashboards: Personalized insights for different user roles. ‚Ä¢ Sharing & Security: Protects candidate data and ensures compliance with organizational policies. ‚Ä¢ Audit Trail: Accountability for system changes.

Deliverables ‚Ä¢ Custom Reports: Candidates by Skills, Certifications by Job Role, Candidate Placement Progress. ‚Ä¢ Dashboards: HR Overview Dashboard, Recruiter Activity Dashboard, Training Outcomes Dashboard. ‚Ä¢ Security Configuration: Sharing rules, field-level security, session settings, login IP ranges. ‚Ä¢ Documentation of Audit Trail logs for review.
